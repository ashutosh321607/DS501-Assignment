    "Here we will first read the JSON data ffrom the 'data.txt' file.\n",
    "<br> <br>\n",
    "As sum of weight of title and abstract is 1, the weight of other entries will be zero. So, we store title and abstract of each document in an array. Note that the order of documents doesnot change. That is, entry of title and abstract present at index i of array title and abstract will be refering to the (i+1)th document in the 'data.txt' file.\n",
    "<br> <br>\n",
    "After storing the data of title and abstract in two different arrays ('title' and 'abstract'), we will create functions which we will use while querying. The functions are:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- postingList: returns a posting list for a given term.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- termList: returns a term list for a given term.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- weightedZonePost: returns the score while using posting list.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- weightedZoneTerm: returns the temperary score while using posting list (we update this later in the code).\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- ZoneScorePostTwo: returns Zone score while quering (posting list) for two terms.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- ZoneScorePostOne: returns Zone score while quering (posting list) for one term.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- ZoneScoreTermTwo: returns Zone score while quering (term list) for two terms.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- ZoneScoreTermOne: returns Zone score while quering (term list) for one term.\n",
    "<br> <br>\n",
    "In this approach, we will be creating the posting list after the query is requested. The other option was to create the posting lists for all possible terms (by iterating through the title and abstract), but this would consume lot of time and space.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "We can also improve the current approach by storing the posting list of a term after a query for that term is made so that the stored posting list can be used when a query for that term is invoked for the second (and further) time, thus saving space and time. But we didn't implement this as it was out of the scope for the requirements of this question.\n",
    "<br> <br>\n",
    "*Note: We are converting the title and abstract to lowercase. Also we are looking for the substring in the title/abstract. For example: if we look for \"schistosoma\" and if \"antischistosomal\" is present in the abstract/title, then it will count it too."

      "Title: onchocerca parasites and wolbachia endosymbionts: evaluation of a spectrum of antibiotic types for activity against onchocerca gutturosa in vitro\n",
      "Abstract: background\n",
      "the filarial parasites of major importance in humans contain the symbiotic bacterium wolbachia and recent studies have shown that targeting of these bacteria with antibiotics results in a reduction in worm viability, development, embryogenesis, and survival. doxycycline has been effective in human trials, but there is a need to develop drugs that can be given for shorter periods and to pregnant women and children. the world health organisation-approved assay to screen for anti-filarial activity in vitro uses male onchocerca gutturosa, with effects being determined by worm motility and viability as measured by reduction of mtt to mtt formazan. here we have used this system to screen antibiotics for anti-filarial activity. in addition we have determined the contribution of wolbachia depletion to the mtt reduction assay.\n",
      "methods\n",
      "adult male o. gutturosa were cultured on a monkey kidney cell (llcmk 2) feeder layer in 24-well plates with antibiotics and antibiotic combinations (6 to 10 worms per group). the macrofilaricide cgp 6140 (amocarzine) was used as a positive control. worm viability was assessed by two methods, (i) motility levels and (ii) mtt/formazan colorimetry. worm motility was scored on a scale of 0 (immotile) to 10 (maximum) every 5 days up to 40 days. on day 40 worm viability was evaluated by mtt/formazan colorimetry, and results were expressed as a mean percentage reduction compared with untreated control values at day 40. to determine the contribution of wolbachia to the mtt assay, the mtt formazan formation of an insect cell-line (c6/36) with or without insect wolbachia infection and treated or untreated with tetracycline was compared.\n",
      "results\n",
      "antibiotics with known anti-wolbachia activity were efficacious in this system. rifampicin (5 × 10-5m) was the most effective anti-mycobacterial agent; clofazimine (1.25 × 10-5m and 3.13 × 10-6m) produced a gradual reduction in motility and by 40 days had reduced worm viability. the other anti-mycobacterial drugs tested had limited or no activity. doxycycline (5 × 10-5m) was filaricidal, but minocycline was more effective and at a lower concentration (5 × 10-5m and 1.25 × 10-5m). inactive compounds included erythromycin, oxytetracycline, trimethoprim and sulphamethoxazole. the mtt assay on the insect cell-line showed that wolbachia made a significant contribution to the metabolic activity within the cells, which could be reduced when they were exposed to tetracycline.\n",
      "conclusion\n",
      "the o. gutturosa adult male screen for anti-filarial drug activity is also valid for the screening of antibiotics for anti-wolbachia activity. in agreement with previous findings, rifampicin and doxycycline were effective; however, the most active antibiotic was minocycline. wolbachia contributed to the formation of mtt formazan in the mtt assay of viability and is therefore not exclusively a measure of worm viability and indicates that wolbachia contributes directly to the metabolic activity of the nematode.\n",

      "Title: species differences in pharmacokinetics and drug teratogenesis.\n",
      "Abstract: interspecies differences in regard to the teratogenicity of drugs can be the result of differing pharmacokinetic processes that determine the crucial concentration-time relationships in the embryo. maternal absorption, as well as distribution, of the drugs does not usually show great species differences. the first-pass effect after oral application is often more pronounced in animals than man (e.g., valproic acid, 13-cis-retinoic acid), although in some cases the reverse was found (e.g., hydrolysis of valpromide). existing differences can be adjusted by appropriate choice of the administration route and measurements of drug levels. many variables determine the placental transfer of drugs: developmental stage, type of placenta, properties of the drug. even closely related drugs (e.g., retinoids) may differ greatly in regard to placental transfer. maternal protein binding is an important determinant of placental transfer, since only the free concentration in maternal plasma can equilibrate with the embryo during organogenesis; this parameter differs greatly across species (e.g., valproic acid: five times higher free fractions in mouse and hamster than in monkey and man). the metabolic pattern has not yet been demonstrated to be a major cause of species differences, although recent evidence on phenytoin and thalidomide support the hypothesis that some species differences can be the result of differing activation/deactivation pathways. laboratory animals usually have a much higher rate of drug elimination than man. drastic drug level fluctuations are therefore present during teratogenicity testing in animals, but not to the same degree in human therapy. it must, therefore, be investigated if peak concentrations (such as for valproic acid and possibly caffeine) or the area under the concentration-time curve (auc) (such as for cyclophosphamide and possibly retinoids) correlate with the teratogenic response. only then is a rational and scientific basis for interspecies comparison possible. it is concluded that the prediction of the human response based on animal studies can be improved by consideration of the appropriate pharmacokinetic determinants.\n",

      "Abstract: background\n",
      "in vitro maturation (ivm) of oocytes followed by fertilization in vitro (ivf) and embryo transfer offers an alternative to conventional ivf treatment that minimises drug administration and avoids ovarian hyperstimulation. however, the technique is less efficient than maturation in vivo. in the present study, a non-human primate model was used to address the hypothesis that the number of oocytes is increased and their nuclear and cytoplasmic maturity after ivm are improved when maturation is initiated in vivo by priming with hcg.\n",
      "methods\n",
      "young, adult cynomolgus monkeys were given recombinant human (rh) gonadotropins to stimulate the development of multiple follicles, and oocytes were aspirated 0, 12, 24, or 36 h after injection of an ovulatory dose of rhcg. the nuclear status of oocytes was determined at the time of recovery and after culture for a total elapsed time of 40–44 hours after hcg.\n",
      "results\n",
      "priming with hcg significantly increased the number of oocytes harvested, especially after delaying aspiration for 24 h or longer. nuclear maturation after the full period in culture was also enhanced by priming: 71.5, 83.6, and 94.6% of oocytes collected at 0, 12, and 24 h hcg had progressed to mii by the end of the culture period, compared to 87.8% of oocytes that were retrieved at 36 h. a large proportion of oocytes reaching the mii stage had either or both abnormal spindles (>40%) and misaligned chromosomes (>60%), judging by immunofluorescence microscopy, but these abnormalities were independent of culture time. the mitochondria were evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm at all stages of maturation. importantly, there was no microscopic evidence that the duration of culture had any injurious effects on the cells.\n",

      "cynomolgus macaques (macaca fascicularis) are widely used as experimental animals in biomedical research and are closely related to other laboratory macaques, such as rhesus macaques (m. mulatta). we isolated 85,721 clones and determined 9407 full-insert sequences from cynomolgus monkey brain, testis, and liver. these sequences were annotated based on homology to human genes and stored in a database, qfbase .\n",

      "we found that 1024 transcripts did not represent any public human cdna sequence and examined their expression using m. fascicularis oligonucleotide microarrays. significant expression was detected for 544 (51%) of the unidentified transcripts. moreover, we identified 226 genes containing exon alterations in the untranslated regions of the macaque transcripts, despite the highly conserved structure of the coding regions. considering the polymorphism in the common ancestor of cynomolgus and rhesus macaques and the rate of pcr errors, the divergence time between the two species was estimated to be around 0.9 million years ago.\n",

      "Abstract: background\n",
      "thyroid receptors, trα and trβ, are involved in important physiological functions such as metabolism, cholesterol level and heart activities. whereas metabolism increase and cholesterol level lowering could be achieved by trβ isoform activation, trα activation affects heart rates. therefore, β-selective thyromimetics have been developed as promising drug-candidates for treatment of obesity and elevated cholesterol level. gc-1 [3,5-dimethyl-4-(4'-hydroxy-3'-isopropylbenzyl)-phenoxy acetic acid] has ability to lower ldl cholesterol with 600- to 1400-fold more potency and approximately two- to threefold more efficacy than atorvastatin (lipitor©) in studies in rats, mice and monkeys.\n",
      "results\n",
      "to investigate gc-1 specificity, we solved crystal structures and performed molecular dynamics simulations of both isoforms complexed with gc-1. crystal structures reveal that, in trα arg228 is observed in multiple conformations, an effect triggered by the differences in the interactions between gc-1 and ser277 or the corresponding asparagine (asn331) of trβ. the corresponding arg282 of trβ is observed in only one single stable conformation, interacting effectively with the ligand. molecular dynamics support this model: our simulations show that the multiple conformations can be observed for the arg228 in trα, in which the ligand interacts either strongly with the ligand or with the ser277 residue. in contrast, a single stable arg282 conformation is observed for trβ, in which it strongly interacts with both gc-1 and the asn331.\n",
      "conclusion\n",
      "our analysis suggests that the key factors for gc-1 selectivity are the presence of an oxyacetic acid ester oxygen and the absence of the amino group relative to t3. these results shed light into the β-selectivity of gc-1 and may assist the development of new compounds with potential as drug candidates to the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and obesity.\n",

      "Abstract: during the early development of the visual cortex, there is a critical period when neuronal connections are highly sensitive to changes in visual input. deprivation of visual stimuli during the critical period elicits robust anatomical and physiological rearrangements in the monkey visual cortex and serves as an excellent model for activity-dependent neuroplasticity. dna microarray experiments were previously performed in our lab to analyze gene expression patterns in area v1 of vervet monkeys subjected to monocular deprivation (md). an interesting candidate identified in its screen was myocyte enhancer-binding factor 2c (mef2c), a transcription factor linked to neuronal survival. consistent with the microarray data, we show that there is a qualitative increase in mef2c protein expression in area v1 of infant as compared to adult vervet monkeys. our results suggest that the regulation of neuronal survival is one of the molecular mechanisms underlying the critical period for visual cortical neuroplasticity.\n",

      "la crosse virus (lacv), family bunyaviridae, was first identified as a human pathogen in 1960 after its isolation from a 4 year-old girl with fatal encephalitis in la crosse, wisconsin. lacv is a major cause of pediatric encephalitis in north america and infects up to 300,000 persons each year of which 70–130 result in severe disease of the central nervous system (cns). as an initial step in the establishment of useful animal models to support vaccine development, we examined lacv infectivity, pathogenesis, and immunogenicity in both weanling mice and rhesus monkeys.\n",
      "results\n",
      "following intraperitoneal inoculation of mice, lacv replicated in various organs before reaching the cns where it replicates to high titer causing death from neurological disease. the peripheral site where lacv replicates to highest titer is the nasal turbinates, and, presumably, lacv can enter the cns via the olfactory neurons from nasal olfactory epithelium. the mouse infectious dose50 and lethal dose50 was similar for lacv administered either intranasally or intraperitoneally. lacv was highly infectious for rhesus monkeys and infected 100% of the animals at 10 pfu. however, the infection was asymptomatic, and the monkeys developed a strong neutralizing antibody response.\n",
      "conclusion\n",
      "in mice, lacv likely gains access to the cns via the blood stream or via olfactory neurons. the ability to efficiently infect mice intranasally raises the possibility that lacv might use this route to infect its natural hosts. rhesus monkeys are susceptible to lacv infection and develop strong neutralizing antibody responses after inoculation with as little as 10 pfu. mice and rhesus monkeys are useful animal models for lacv vaccine immunologic testing although the rhesus monkey model is not optimal.\n",

      "Abstract: nuclear receptor 2e1 (nr2e1) is expressed in human fetal and adult brains; however, its role in human brain–behavior development is unknown. previously, we have corrected the cortical hypoplasia and behavioral abnormalities in nr2e1−/− mice using a genomic clone spanning human nr2e1, which bolsters the hypothesis that nr2e1 may similarly play a role in human cortical and behavioral development. to test the hypothesis that humans with abnormal brain–behavior development may have null or hypomorphic nr2e1 mutations, we undertook the first candidate mutation screen of nr2e1 by sequencing its entire coding region, untranslated, splice site, proximal promoter and evolutionarily conserved non-coding regions in 56 unrelated patients with cortical disorders, namely microcephaly. we then genotyped the candidate mutations in 325 unrelated control subjects and 15 relatives. we did not detect any coding region changes in nr2e1; however, we identified seven novel candidate regulatory mutations that were absent from control subjects. we used in silico tools to predict the effects of these candidate mutations on neural transcription factor binding sites (tfbs). four candidate mutations were predicted to alter tfbs. to facilitate the present and future studies of nr2e1, we also elucidated its molecular evolution, genetic diversity, haplotype structure and linkage disequilibrium by sequencing an additional 94 unaffected humans representing africa, the americas, asia, europe, the middle east and oceania, as well as great apes and monkeys. we detected strong purifying selection, low genetic diversity, 21 novel polymorphisms and five common haplotypes at nr2e1. we conclude that protein-coding changes in nr2e1 do not contribute to cortical and behavioral abnormalities in the patients examined here, but that regulatory mutations may play a role.\n",

      "Abstract: quantitative aspects of platelet agglutination and inhibition of clot retraction by the antibody of quinidine purpura were described. the reactions appeared to depend on formation of types of antibody-quinidine-platelet complexes which could fix complement but complement was not necessary for these reactions. complement fixation was at least 10 times more sensitive than platelet agglutination or inhibition of clot retraction for measurement and detection of antibody activity. although it has been considered that antibodies of drug purpura act as platelet lysins in the presence of complement and that direct lysis of platelets accounts for development of thrombocytopenia in drug purpura, the present study suggests that attachment of antibody produces a change in platelets which is manifested in vitro only by increased susceptibility to non-specific factors which can alter the stability of platelets in the absence of antibody. the attachment of antibody to platelets in vivo may only indirectly affect platelet survival. in contrast to human platelets, dog, rabbit, and guinea pig platelets, and normal or trypsin-treated human red cells did not agglutinate, fix complement, or adsorb antibody; and intact human endothelial cells did not fix complement or adsorb antibody. rhesus monkey platelets were not agglutinated by the antibody but did adsorb antibody and fix complement although their activity in these reactions differed quantitatively from that of human platelets. cinchonine could be substituted for quinidine in agglutination and inhibition of clot retraction reactions but quinine and cinchonidine could not. attempts to cause passive anaphylaxis in guinea pigs with the antibody of quinidine purpura were not successful.\n",

      "Abstract: the first known epidemic of poliomyelitis in easton, pennsylvania, occurred in 1949, and was unusual in the high proportion of paralytic to non-paralytic cases. both poliomyelitis and cosxackie, or c, viruses were isolated from more than half the patients studied during the acute stage of the disease. one month later c virus was only occasionally recovered. classification of the 28 strains of c virus which were isolated revealed that 24 belonged to one antigenic type, easton-2 (related to albany type 1 virus). patients from whom c virus was isolated showed a rise during convalescence to the easton-2 or homologous type antibody. two patients with paralytic poliomyelitis were studied for the quantitative development of antibodies to the poliomyelitis virus and to the c virus found in their stools. using the neutralization test in monkeys and in newborn mice, respectively, a simultaneous rise in antibodies to both agents was observed. the situation at present can be summarized as follows:—poliomyelitis virus or c virus may produce infection in man, with a specific antibody response. both agents may be carried, particularly in the intestines, without causing any serious illness and healthy carrier states have been observed for each. both viruses can be found in nature in flies and in sewage. however there has been no evidence to suggest that these two viruses bear a relationship to each other, even when isolated from the same patient. thus, when both viruses are found in a patient with paralysis, it is not yet possible to say with any degree of accuracy to what extent each is responsible in the over-all pattern of the disease. how frequently dual infections of this nature may occur remains for future investigations to determine. certainly all cases of poliomyelitis are not complicated by a superimposed infection with a c virus. however, this will have to be one more item to consider in epidemic poliomyelitis.\n",

      "Abstract: the preparation of antigenic materials capable of specific fixation of complement in the presence of convalescent phase sera from patients with varicella and herpes zoster is described. satisfactory antigens were obtained by the repetitive harvest and subsequent concentration of the pooled nutrient fluids from bottle cultures of human embryonic skin-muscle tissue or of monkey kidney tissue infected with varicella or herpes zoster viruses. specific fixation of complement was also demonstrated with antigens prepared from extracts of the infected cell sheets harvested from bottle cultures. in individuals with varicella, complement-fixing antibody usually appeared in the serum 4 or 5 days after the development of the exanthem and further significant increases in titer were characteristically observed during the 2nd week of illness. the complement-fixing antibody response in herpes zoster tended to follow the same pattern as in varicella, with the exception that in sera from some individuals relatively high titers were present in the acute phase specimen. complement-fixing antigens prepared from varicella strains or from a zoster strain reacted to essentially the same degree with convalescent sera from the homologous and the heterologous clinical entities. the varicella-zoster antigens did not fix complement in the presence of paired sera obtained from a limited number of individuals with primary infections due to herpes simplex virus or from individuals with generalized vaccinia infection. specific inhibition in vitro of the focal cytopathic process produced by the varicella-zoster viruses was demonstrated. this was accomplished by the incorporation of the sera under test as constituents of nutrient media of the cultures, either prior to or at the time of their inoculation with virus. the neutralization of focal cytopathogenicity thus obtained was relative in degree and never absolute; it was therefore assayed by repetitive counts of the number of focal lesions per culture in the various test groups. inhibition of varicella-zoster viral cytopathogenicity occurred in the presence of convalescent serum from either clinical entity. the results of the immunologic studies with the viruses of herpes zoster and varicella as propagated in vitro are considered as providing further evidence in support of the concept of the close relationship and probable identity of the two agents.\n",

      "Title: nutritional cytopenia in monkeys receiving the goldberger diet\n",
      "Abstract: experiments are reported upon young rhesus monkeys which were given a diet essentially the same as the goldberger black tongue-producing diet, supplemented in various ways. those receiving the unsupplemented diet developed the syndrome characterized by leucopenia, anemia, gingivitis, diarrhea, and death, which has been previously described in monkeys receiving our diet of refined foodstuffs. an animal receiving the goldberger diet supplemented with ascorbic acid and liver extract exhibited normal growth and development and has maintained a normal blood picture for approximately 2 years. likewise, the feeding of a crude liver extract to an animal with profound anemia and leucopenia was followed by a dramatic reticulocyte response and ultimate recovery. however, the ash of liver extract failed to maintain a normal blood picture or to prolong life. supplementing the diet with ascorbic acid, thiamin chloride, nicotinic acid (or amide), and riboflavin failed to prevent the leucopenia, gingivitis, diarrhea, and death. the combination of nicotinic acid and riboflavin, however, appeared to have a definite erythropoietic effect. shigella paradysenteriae was isolated from the stools of several of the animals which received the deficient diet. further studies are needed to clarify the relationship between the deficiency, the infection, and the blood picture. three of the animals exhibited edema of the face. it is evident that the goldberger diet, even when supplemented with nicotinic acid, riboflavin, thiamin, and ascorbic acid, is inadequate for maintenance of health in the young monkey. the nature of the deficiency manifestations would indicate that the diet is deficient in the substance or substances which we have previously termed vitamin m.\n",

      "Abstract: the virus inhibitory activity and selectivity of certain benzimidazole, benzotriazole, and naphthimidazole derivatives were determined with influenza b and polio type 2 viruses. among the sixty-five compounds examined, several were highly active inhibitors of influenza b virus multiplication in the chorioallantoic membrane in vitro. the following compounds, listed in order of increasing inhibitory activity, were more than 100 times as active as benzimidazole: 5-(4'-toluenesulfonamido)-benzimidazole, 5-hydroxybenzotriazole-4-carboxy-α-naphthylamide, 4,5,6-trichlorobenzotriazole, 5-(3',4'-dichlorobenzenesulfonamido)-benzimidazole, 5-(3',4'-dichlorobenzenesulfonamido) - 1 - (3'',4'' - dichlorobenzenesulfonyl)-benzimidazole, 4-(p-chlorophenylazo)-5-hydroxybenzotriazole, and 4,5,6,7-tetrachlorobenzotriazole. however, none showed high selectivity. of the sixty-five compounds studied with influenza virus, twenty-five were also examined with poliovirus type 2 in monkey kidney cells in vitro. included in this group were five of the seven most active inhibitors of influenza virus, listed above. all five were more than 100 times as active in inhibiting poliovirus multiplication as the reference compound. in addition to these, two other compounds were highly active: 2-(α-hydroxybenzyl)-benzimidazole (hbb), and 2-(α-hydroxybenzyl)-5-chlorobenzimidazole, with relative inhibitory activities of 78 and 130, respectively. these two compounds, and the much less active 5,6-dichloro derivative of hbb, were the only ones which showed no, or only slight, toxic effects on cells at concentrations sufficient to cause considerable inhibition of poliovirus multiplication. furthermore, hbb and the 5-chloro derivative were the only compounds which caused significant inhibition of the cytopathic effects of poliovirus. hbb, and its 5-chloro and 5,6-dichloro derivatives had no effect on the multiplication of influenza b virus in the chorioallantoic membrane. in addition, hbb failed to inhibit influenza b virus multiplication and cytopathic effects in monkey kidney cells. inhibition of poliovirus-induced cell damage by hbb was characterized by the following features: the curves relating reduction in virus yield or cytopathic effects to concentration of the compound followed an approximately parallel course; somewhat higher concentrations were required to inhibit virus-induced cell damage than to reduce virus yield. hbb suppressed viral cytopathic effects for a period of time which varied directly with the concentration of compound, and inversely with the size of virus inoculum. the development of virus-induced cell damage in treated cultures on prolonged incubation was not due to inactivation of hbb. the inhibitory effect of hbb on virus-induced cell damage was reversible by removal of the compound. hbb inhibited viral cytopathic effects when given during the exponential increase phase in virus multiplication. inhibition of virus-induced cell damage by hbb was demonstrated by photomicrographs. hbb did not inactivate the infectivity of poliovirus type 2.\n",

      "Title: protective action of certain chemicals against infection of monkeys with nasally instilled poliomyelitis virus\n",
      "Abstract: in the present investigation evidence was obtained indicating that nasal instillations of suitable concentrations of sodium alum or tannic acid induce in macacus rhesus monkeys resistance to the development of poliomyelitis when the virus is introduced by the nasal route. it was found that apparently different concentrations of these chemicals are required to exert this type of protective effect in different hosts or against different viruses, for while mice are readily protected against nasal infection with equine encephalomyelitis virus by 0.5 per cent solutions of tannic acid or alum (7), monkeys require at least 3 per cent solutions to become resistant against poliomyelitis. experiments designed to elucidate the development of this refractory state in monkeys indicate that it is a result of the action of these chemicals not upon the virus but rather upon the tissues of the host (probably the olfactory mucosa); further evidence in favor of this hypothesis may be found in the observation that several days of treatment are required before resistance is induced. while one nasal instillation a day for 3 days proved effective when additional treatments were given on the days of virus administration, there was no protection against infection when the virus was given 48 and 96 hours after the last treatment. the resistance which was demonstrable when the virus was instilled intranasally on the 4th and 6th days after the beginning of treatment was also found to be present a week later when the treatments were given daily, indicating that the refractory state can be maintained in this manner. it was observed, however, that monkeys which were given nasal instillations of alum or tannic acid for 5 days or more may retain the resistance they acquired for 1 or 2 months without any additional treatment (table v); thus, of 15 refractory monkeys retested after 1 month, 11 were still resistant; seven of 15 monkeys were refractory when retested after 2 months, while only one of 11 failed to develop poliomyelitis after an interval of 3 months. these last results suggest that to maintain such a refractory state over a period of months it may be necessary to employ daily instillations only for about a week, with subsequent repetitions at intervals of several days or a week. an experiment performed to determine the effect of beginning alum treatment soon after, rather than before, the virus is administered, indicated that there is no danger from a possible early or primary effect enhancing the invasiveness of the virus. one cannot state with any certainty, however, whether or not in some of the monkeys so treated the development of poliomyelitis is inhibited or prevented. finally, it should be stressed that treatment with alum or tannic acid either completely prevented the disease in monkeys, or else was entirely without effect. it is therefore not surprising that no evidence was obtained of development of specific, active immunity in monkeys rendered refractory by chemical treatment. as far as could be ascertained, the nasal instillation of tannic acid or alum in man proved thoroughly innocuous beyond some local irritation for a short time. the desirability of testing this procedure as an aid in the prevention of poliomyelitis in man during the months of greatest incidence or during epidemics is quite apparent. in conclusion, there may be broader implications in this approach to the prevention of certain infectious diseases transmitted naturally or experimentally by way of the nose. it seems desirable to make studies with other viruses transmitted by the nasal route, including those of influenza and the common cold. the evidence obtained in the present study that the chemically induced refractory state may persist in a large number of monkeys for a month or two after treatment over a period of 5 days or more, suggests that studies on individuals who are subject to frequent attacks of common cold may perhaps be profitable.\n",

      "Abstract: 1. the vital importance of the cellular defense forces in the resistance of the monkey to combined streptococcus and influenza virus infections has been demonstrated. 2. some of the conditions prejudicial to the maintenance of an optimum cellular reserve in the infected animal have been revealed; viz., undernutrition, physical cold, intratracheal route of infection. 3. the potential threat exerted by latent foci of streptococci, and the importance, in relation to the combined infection with virus, of cellular and humoral immunity, together or separately, have been demonstrated. the essential rôle of optimum nutrition (notably as concerns the vitamin b complex, and folic acid specifically) in the prevention of disastrous illness from these infectious agents, individually or in combination, would seem to have been proven. 4. signs of glomerular nephritis appeared in a significant number of monkeys receiving streptococcus hemolyticus and influenza virus in sequence, followed by reinoculation or spontaneous reappearance of the streptococci. 5. reinoculation of streptococcus hemolyticus, group c, resulted in a prompt \"booster\" increase in the opsonic index. virus instillation was followed by just as sudden a depression in this index. 6. reinoculation failed to evoke either the granulocytosis or the leucopenia in monkeys which are characteristic effects of the streptococcus and the virus respectively when these agents are introduced for the first time by way of the nasal mucous membrane. 7. simultaneous intranasal inoculation of influenza virus, type a, and streptococcus hemolyticus, group c, in nutritionally normal macaca mulatta failed to produce obvious signs of disease. in most of the animals, however, a streptococcus-induced leucocytosis followed by a delayed virus-induced granulopenia developed. 8. inoculation of influenza virus followed in 4 to 17 days by streptococci produced obvious signs of disease in five of eleven animals which had become leucopenic as result of the action of the virus, and fatal streptococcal septicemia in two monkeys. 9. the development of signs of infection in previously healthy monkeys exposed to virus followed by streptococci confirms both the clinical and laboratory experience of other observers, that virus infection may predispose to secondary bacterial invasion, and, that at times, under unfavorable circumstances, the infection may become overwhelming. although the complete mechanism of resistance is as yet not wholly clear, the depressant or inhibitory effect of the virus on both its cellular and humoral elements has been established.\n",

      "Abstract: since the experimental data have already been discussed at some length, it is here necessary only to review those observations which appear to be of most significance. the manifestations of the disease we have produced in monkeys have in general been similar to those described by previous workers. it has been found that members of the species m. mulatta are regularly susceptible to infection with the virus of mumps, provided they have not been in contact with animals which have recently been infected. such contact may be followed by the development of resistance to inoculation unattended by overt signs of infection. following the intraparotid injection of virus into a susceptible animal, an antigen appears in the gland which reacts specifically in the complement fixation test with sera of monkeys which have recovered from an attack of mumps. this antigen has not been demonstrated in any other organ of the infected monkey which has been examined, nor does it persist or increase in amount when introduced into the brain or the testes. attempts to propagate it in the tissues of other animal species including the developing hen's egg and tissue cultures have so far been uniformly unsuccessful. the antigen is relatively thermostabile, resisting a temperature of 65°c. for at least 20 minutes at the optimal hydrogen ion concentration. it is unimpaired by a concentration of formalin of 0.3 per cent. together with the virus it may be preserved indefinitely in the frozen state. the maximal quantity of antigen in the gland, which may be considerable, is attained on or about the 5th day following inoculation of the virus. an antibody which reacts with the antigen appears in the serum from 8 to 14 days after infection. this antibody has not been found in the serum of normal monkeys which have had no opportunity for contact with the virus. it has been demonstrated during convalescence in the serum of all animals which have been examined. the antibody which is present in large amounts soon after recovery, although decreasing in concentration with the lapse of time, may continue to be present for many months. at 62°c. for 20 minutes its activity is not reduced and on storage at 4°c. its titer has remained unaltered for over 2 years. a similar factor which appears in human beings convalescent from mumps is less stabile, since its activity is reduced appreciably under these conditions. in the co2 cabinet, however, both antibodies can be preserved for long periods of time. the definition of these reagents has afforded means whereby the simian infection with the virus of mumps, whether it is actively in progress or has occurred at some time in the past, can be recognized. upon the establishment of these facts, the estimation of the quantity of antigen in the glands of vaccinated animals was employed as an index of their resistance in studies on the effect of the injection of formolized and alumprecipitated formolized suspensions of infected parotid gland. it has been shown that such vaccines, in which the virus has been rendered inactive, lead to the production of complement-fixing antibody. in about 60 per cent of the vaccinated animals, moreover, evidence of increased resistance was obtained as indicated by the partial or complete suppression of the formation of antigen in the inoculated gland. in certain instances no evidence of resistance was observed, yet antibody was found to be present. it is clear, therefore, that resistance is not determined solely by the presence of the complement-fixing antibody. the possibility, however, of its participation as a factor in immunity cannot be excluded. employing the same criterion of resistance, the virus-neutralizing capacity of a pool of human mumps convalescent sera and of a globulin concentrate prepared from the pool has been studied. neither of these materials was found to prevent entirely the formation of antigen, although each of them appeared to exert some inhibitory effect.\n",

      "how are morphological evolution and developmental changes related? this rather old and intriguing question had a substantial boost after the 70s within the framework of heterochrony (changes in rates or timing of development) and nowadays has the potential to make another major leap forward through the combination of approaches: molecular biology, developmental experimentation, comparative systematic studies, geometric morphometrics and quantitative genetics. here i take an integrated approach combining life-history comparative analyses, classical and geometric morphometrics applied to ontogenetic series to understand changes in size and shape which happen during the evolution of two new world monkeys (nwm) sister genera.\n",
      "results\n",
      "cebus and saimiri share the same basic allometric patterns in skull traits, a result robust to sexual and ontogenetic variation. if adults of both genera are compared in the same scale (discounting size differences) most differences are small and not statistically significant. these results are consistent using both approaches, classical and geometric morphometrics. cebus is a genus characterized by a number of peramorphic traits (adult-like) while saimiri is a genus with paedomorphic (child like) traits. yet, the whole clade cebinae is characterized by a unique combination of very high pre-natal growth rates and relatively slow post-natal growth rates when compared to the rest of the nwm. morphologically cebinae can be considered paedomorphic in relation to the other nwm. geometric morphometrics allows the precise separation of absolute size, shape variation associated with size (allometry), and shape variation non-associated with size. interestingly, and despite the fact that they were extracted as independent factors (principal components), evolutionary allometry (those differences in allometric shape associated with intergeneric differences) and ontogenetic allometry (differences in allometric shape associated with ontogenetic variation within genus) are correlated within these two genera. furthermore, morphological differences produced along these two axes are quite similar. cebus and saimiri are aligned along the same evolutionary allometry and have parallel ontogenetic allometry trajectories.\n",
      "conclusion\n",
      "the evolution of these two platyrrhini monkeys is basically due to a size differentiation (and consequently to shape changes associated with size). many life-history changes are correlated or may be the causal agents in such evolution, such as delayed on-set of reproduction in cebus and larger neonates in saimiri.\n",

      "Abstract: background\n",
      "the rectum is particularly vulnerable to hiv transmission having only a single protective layer of columnar epithelium overlying tissue rich in activated lymphoid cells; thus, unprotected anal intercourse in both women and men carries a higher risk of infection than other sexual routes. in the absence of effective prophylactic vaccines, increasing attention is being given to the use of microbicides and preventative antiretroviral (arv) drugs. to prevent mucosal transmission of hiv, a microbicide/arv should ideally act locally at and near the virus portal of entry. as part of an integrated rectal microbicide development programme, we have evaluated rectal application of the nucleotide reverse transcriptase (rt) inhibitor tenofovir (pmpa, 9-[(r)-2-(phosphonomethoxy) propyl] adenine monohydrate), a drug licensed for therapeutic use, for protective efficacy against rectal challenge with simian immunodeficiency virus (siv) in a well-established and standardised macaque model.\n",
      "methods and findings\n",
      "a total of 20 purpose-bred indian rhesus macaques were used to evaluate the protective efficacy of topical tenofovir. nine animals received 1% tenofovir gel per rectum up to 2 h prior to virus challenge, four macaques received placebo gel, and four macaques remained untreated. in addition, three macaques were given tenofovir gel 2 h after virus challenge. following intrarectal instillation of 20 median rectal infectious doses (mid50) of a noncloned, virulent stock of sivmac251/32h, all animals were analysed for virus infection, by virus isolation from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc), quantitative proviral dna load in pbmc, plasma viral rna (vrna) load by sensitive quantitative competitive (qc) rt-pcr, and presence of siv-specific serum antibodies by elisa. we report here a significant protective effect (p = 0.003; fisher exact probability test) wherein eight of nine macaques given tenofovir per rectum up to 2 h prior to virus challenge were protected from infection (n = 6) or had modified virus outcomes (n = 2), while all untreated macaques and three of four macaques given placebo gel were infected, as were two of three animals receiving tenofovir gel after challenge. moreover, analysis of lymphoid tissues post mortem failed to reveal sequestration of siv in the protected animals. we found a strong positive association between the concentration of tenofovir in the plasma 15 min after rectal application of gel and the degree of protection in the six animals challenged with virus at this time point. moreover, colorectal explants from non-siv challenged tenofovir-treated macaques were resistant to infection ex vivo, whereas no inhibition was seen in explants from the small intestine. tissue-specific inhibition of infection was associated with the intracellular detection of tenofovir. intriguingly, in the absence of seroconversion, gag-specific gamma interferon (ifn-γ)-secreting t cells were detected in the blood of four of seven protected animals tested, with frequencies ranging from 144 spot forming cells (sfc)/106 pbmc to 261 spot forming cells (sfc)/106 pbmc.\n",
      "conclusions\n",
      "these results indicate that colorectal pretreatment with arv drugs, such as tenofovir, has potential as a clinically relevant strategy for the prevention of hiv transmission. we conclude that plasma tenofovir concentration measured 15 min after rectal administration may serve as a surrogate indicator of protective efficacy. this may prove to be useful in the design of clinical studies. furthermore, in vitro intestinal explants served as a model for drug distribution in vivo and susceptibility to virus infection. the finding of t cell priming following exposure to virus in the absence of overt infection is provocative. further studies would reveal if a combined modality microbicide and vaccination strategy is feasible by determining the full extent of local immune responses induced and their protective potential.\n",
      "background.\n",
      "about 33 million people are now infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv), which causes aids by killing immune system cells. as yet, there is no cure for aids, although hiv infections can be held in check with antiretroviral drugs. also, despite years of research, there is no vaccine available that effectively protects people against hiv infection. so, to halt the aids epidemic, other ways of preventing the spread of hiv are being sought. for example, pre-exposure treatment (prophylaxis) with antiretroviral drugs is being investigated as a way to prevent hiv transmission. in addition, because hiv is often spread through heterosexual penile-to-vaginal sex with an infected partner, several vaginal microbicides (compounds that protect against hiv when applied inside the vagina) are being developed, some of which contain antiretroviral drugs.\n",
      "why was this study done?\n",
      "because hiv can cross the membranes that line the mouth and the rectum (the lower end of the large intestine that connects to the anus) in addition to the membrane that lines the vagina, hiv transmission can also occur during oral and anal sex. the lining of the rectum in particular is extremely thin and overlies tissues rich in activated t cells (the immune system cells that hiv targets), so unprotected anal intercourse carries a high risk of hiv infection. anal intercourse is common among men who have sex with men but is also more common in heterosexual populations than is generally thought. tenofovir (an antiretroviral drug that counteracts hiv after it has entered human cells) given by mouth partly protects macaques against rectal infection with simian immunodeficiency virus (siv; a virus that induces aids in monkeys and apes) so the researchers wanted to know whether this drug might be effective against rectal siv infection if applied at the site where the virus enters the body.\n",
      "what did the researchers do and find?\n",
      "to answer this question, the researchers rectally infected several macaques with siv up to 2 h after rectal application of a gel containing tenofovir, after rectal application of a gel not containing the drug, or after no treatment. in addition, a few animals were treated with the tenofovir gel after the viral challenge. most of the animals given the tenofovir gel before the viral challenge were partly or totally protected from siv infection, whereas all the untreated animals and most of those treated with the placebo gel or with the drug-containing gel after the viral challenge became infected with siv. high blood levels of tenofovir 15 min after its rectal application correlated with protection from viral infection. the researchers also collected rectal and small intestine samples from tenofovir-treated macaques that had not been exposed to siv and asked which samples were resistant to siv infection in laboratory dishes. they found that only the rectal samples were resistant to infection and only rectal cells contained tenofovir. finally, activated t cells that recognized an siv protein were present in the blood of some of the animals that were protected from siv infection by the tenofovir gel.\n",
      "what do these findings mean?\n",
      "these findings, although based on experiments in only a few animals, suggest that rectal treatment with antiretroviral drugs before rectal exposure to hiv might prevent rectal hiv transmission in people. however, results from animal experiments do not always reflect what happens in people. indeed, clinical trials of a potential vaginal microbicide that worked well in macaques were halted recently because women using the microbicide had higher rates of hiv infection than those using a control preparation. the finding that immune-system activation can occur in the absence of overt infection in animals treated with the tenofovir gel additionally suggests that a combination of a local antiretroviral/microbicide and vaccination might be a particularly effective way to prevent hiv transmission. however, because hiv targets activated t cells, viral rechallenge experiments must be done to check that the activated t cells induced by the virus in the presence of tenofovir do not increase the likelihood of infection upon re-exposure to hiv before this potential microbicide is tried in people.\n",

      "Abstract: purpose\n",
      "amblyopia is the most common cause of visual impairment in children. early detection of amblyopia and subsequent intervention are vital in preventing visual loss. understanding the molecular pathogenesis of amblyopia would greatly facilitate development of therapeutic interventions. an animal model of amblyopia induced by monocular vision deprivation has been extensively studied in terms of anatomic and physiologic alterations that affect visual pathways. however, the molecular events underlying these changes are poorly understood. this study aimed to characterize changes of gene expression profiles in the lateral geniculate nucleus (lgn) associated with amblyopia induced by monocular visual deprivation.\n",
      "methods\n",
      "monocular vision deprivation was generated by either opaque dark contact lens or tarsorrhaphy of newborn rhesus monkeys. lgn was harvested at two or four months following induction of vision deprivation. laser capture microdissection was used to obtain individual lgn layers for total rna isolation. linear t7-based in vitro rna amplification was used to obtain sufficient rna to conduct dna microarray studies. the resulting affymetrix genechip expression data were analyzed using affymetrix genechip operating software. real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization were used to further analyze expression of selected genes.\n",
      "results\n",
      "using 52,699 microarray probe sets from a rhesus array, we identified 116 transcripts differentially expressed between deprived and nondeprived parvocellular layers: 45 genes were downregulated and 71 genes were upregulated in deprived parvocellular layers. we also observed substantial changes in deprived magnocellular laminae: 74 transcripts exhibited altered expression, 42 genes were downregulated, and 32 genes were upregulated. the genes identified in this study are involved in many diverse processes, including binding (calcium ion binding, nucleic acid binding, and nucleotide binding), catalytic activity, and signal transducer activity.\n",
      "conclusions\n",
      "there were significant differences in gene expression profiles between deprived and nondeprived parvocellular layers and magnocellular laminae of lgn. these alterations in gene expression may play a critical role in the molecular pathogenesis of amblyopia. the genes identified in this study may provide potential targets for therapeutic intervention of this disease.\n",

      "Abstract: background\n",
      "poxvirus-vectored vaccines against infectious diseases and cancer are currently under development. we hypothesized that the extensive use of poxvirus-vectored vaccine in future might result in co-infection and recombination between the vaccine virus and naturally occurring poxviruses, resulting in hybrid viruses with unpredictable characteristics. previously, we confirmed that co-infecting in vitro a modified vaccinia virus ankara (mva) strain engineered to express influenza virus haemagglutinin (ha) and nucleoprotein (np) genes with a naturally occurring cowpox virus (cpxv-noh1) resulted in recombinant progeny viruses (h hansen, mi okeke, ø nilssen, t traavik, vaccine 23: 499–506, 2004). in this study we analyzed the biological properties of parental and progeny hybrid viruses.\n",
      "results\n",
      "five cpxv/mva progeny viruses were isolated based on plaque phenotype and the expression of influenza virus ha protein. progeny hybrid viruses displayed in vitro cell line tropism of cpxv-noh1, but not that of mva. the ha transgene or its expression was lost on serial passage of transgenic viruses and the speed at which ha expression was lost varied with cell lines. the ha transgene in the progeny viruses or its expression was stable in african green monkey derived vero cells but became unstable in rat derived iec-6 cells. hybrid viruses lacking the ha transgene have higher levels of virus multiplication in mammalian cell lines and produced more enveloped virions than the transgene positive progenitor virus strain. analysis of the subcellular localization of the transgenic ha protein showed that neither virus strain nor cell line have effect on the subcellular targets of the ha protein. the influenza virus ha protein was targeted to enveloped virions, plasma membrane, golgi apparatus and cytoplasmic vesicles.\n",
      "conclusion\n",
      "our results suggest that homologous recombination between poxvirus-vectored vaccine and naturally circulating poxviruses, genetic instability of the transgene, accumulation of non-transgene expressing vectors or hybrid virus progenies, as well as cell line/type specific selection against the transgene are potential complications that may result if poxvirus vectored vaccines are extensively used in animals and man.\n",

      "Abstract: we used mandrills (mandrillus sphinx) naturally infected with simian t-cell leukemia virus type 1 (stlv-1) as a model for evaluating the influence of natural stlv-1 infection on the dynamics and evolution of the immune system during chronic infection. furthermore, in order to evaluate the role of the immune system in controlling the infection during latency, we induced immunosuppression in the infected monkeys. we first showed that the stlv-1 proviral load was higher in males than in females and increased significantly with the duration of infection: mandrills infected for 10–6 years had a significantly higher proviral load than those infected for 2–4 years. curiously, this observation was associated with a clear reduction in cd4+ t-cell number with age. we also found that the percentage of cd4+ t cells co-expressing the activation marker hla-dr and the mean percentage of cd25+ in cd4+ and cd8+ t cells were significantly higher in infected than in uninfected animals. furthermore, the stlv-1 proviral load correlated positively with t-cell activation but not with the frequency of t cells secreting interferon γ in response to tax peptides. lastly, we showed that, during immunosuppression in infected monkeys, the percentages of cd8+ t cells expressing hla-dr+ and of cd4+ t cells expressing the proliferation marker ki67 decreased significantly, although the percentage of cd8+ t cells expressing hla-dr+ and ki67 increased significantly by the end of treatment. interestingly, the proviral load increased significantly after immunosuppression in the monkey with the highest load. our study demonstrates that mandrills naturally infected with stlv-1 could be a suitable model for studying the relations between host and virus. further studies are needed to determine whether the different compartments of the immune response during infection induce the long latency by controlling viral replication over time. such studies would provide important information for the development of immune-based therapeutic strategies.\n",

      "Abstract: the primate somatosensory system provides an excellent model system with which to investigate adult neural plasticity. here, we report immunohistochemical staining data for the glur1 and glur2/3 ampa receptors subunits in somatosensory area 3b 1 week after median nerve compression in adult squirrel monkeys. we find transcortical increases in the staining intensity of glur1 ampar subunits and transcortical decreases in glur2/3 ampar subunits. this pattern of change in the staining intensity of these subunits differs from the changes one would expect if the deprived cortical neurons were undergoing homeostatic synaptic scaling, or from ones that would follow n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptor-mediated long-term potentiation. indeed, this pattern of change appears to recapitulate proportions that exist early in development as if the deprived cortex has reverted to an immature state. we suggest that this state represents yet another stage of peripheral nerve injury-induced reorganization in adult primate somatosensory cortex, and may well be essential for subsequent nmda receptor-mediated plasticity.\n",

      "Abstract: simian immunodeficiency virus (siv) infection leads to aids in experimentally infected macaques, whereas natural reservoir hosts exhibit limited disease and pathology. it is, however, unclear how natural hosts can sustain high viral loads, comparable to those observed in the pathogenic model, without developing severe disease. we performed transcriptional profiling on lymph node, blood, and colon samples from african green monkeys (natural host model) and asian pigtailed macaques (pathogenic model) to directly compare gene expression patterns during acute pathogenic versus non-pathogenic siv infection. the majority of gene expression changes that were unique to either model were detected in the lymph nodes at the time of peak viral load. results suggest a shift toward cellular stress pathways and th1 profiles during pathogenic infection, with strong and sustained type i and ii interferon responses. in contrast, a strong type i interferon response was initially induced during non-pathogenic infection but resolved after peak viral load. the natural host also exhibited controlled th1 profiles and better preservation of overall cell homeostasis. this study identified gene expression patterns that are specific to disease susceptibility, tissue compartmentalization, and infection duration. these patterns provide a unique view of how host responses differ depending upon lentiviral infection outcome.simian immunodeficiency virus (siv) does not cause disease in african green monkeys (a natural host for the virus), whereas experimentally infected asian macaques (a non-natural host) develop a progressive disease that is similar to that which occurs in hiv-infected humans. insight into how hiv causes disease and leads to development of aids may therefore be gained by comparing the response of natural and non-natural hosts to siv infection. to this end, we examined changes that occurred in gene expression levels over time and in multiple tissues derived from african green monkeys and asian macaques experimentally infected with siv. infection leads to host-specific gene expression patterns in lymph nodes, blood, and colon. the natural and non-natural hosts differed with respect to the timing, intensity, and duration of infection-induced gene expression changes associated with inflammation and response to stress.\n",

      "Abstract: chronic immune activation and progression to aids are observed after siv infection in macaques but not in natural host primate species. to better understand this dichotomy, we compared acute pathogenic siv infection in pigtailed macaques (pts) to non-pathogenic infection in african green monkeys (agms). sivagm-infected pts, but not sivagm-infected agms, rapidly developed systemic immune activation, marked and selective depletion of il-17-secreting (th17) cells, and loss of the balance between th17 and t regulatory (treg) cells in blood, lymphoid organs, and mucosal tissue. the loss of th17 cells was found to be predictive of systemic and sustained t cell activation. collectively, these data indicate that loss of the th17 to treg balance is related to siv disease progression.natural infection by the simian immunodeficiency virus (siv) in over 40 different species of african non-human primates is not accompanied by progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids). to understand this phenomenon, we have performed a detailed virologic, immunologic, and gene expression analysis of acute siv infection of two disparate species: the african green monkey (agm), in which siv infection is nonpathogenic, and the asian pigtailed macaque (pt), in which siv infection results in aids. after experimental infection, animals of both species developed high viral loads. in the pts, viremia was associated with cd4+ t cell depletion in the peripheral blood and multiple signs of persistent immune activation and inflammation. such pathology was not observed in agms. notably, the agms maintained high and balanced levels of two subset populations of cd4+ t cells, e.g., the immunosuppressive t regulatory (treg) and the il-17 producing (th17) populations, whereas the pts did not. further analysis of the role of th17 and treg balance during pathogenic lentiviral infection may provide novel insights into our understanding of siv and hiv pathogenesis and future thoughts about vaccine development.\n",

      "Abstract: the experiments recorded in this paper serve, in the first place, to confirm the experiments of dixon and halliburton on the stimulating effect of intravenous injections of extracts of choroid plexus in the secretion of the cerebrospinal fluid, and extend their observations to monkeys. they bring out also the variable effects of the virus of poliomyelitis, variations affected by the quality of the virus and also by the individual powers of resistance to infection possessed by individual monkeys. these factors of variation must be taken into account in performing and interpreting experiments on infection and particularly those on immunity and specific therapy in relation to poliomyelitis. in general it may be said that experimental infection by way of the blood is not easy to produce in monkeys unless some contributing factor, such as the existence of a coincident aseptic meningitis, operates at the same time. and yet experiments 1 and 2 show that when the strength of the virus is great the injection of relatively considerable quantities suffices to induce infection and paralysis, but not in all instances. the chief outcome of the experiments has been to determine the fact that when the intravenous inoculation of the virus does not in itself suffice to induce infection and paralysis, the intravenous injection of extracts of the choroid plexus, which in themselves excite the secretory functions which preside over the formation of the cerebrospinal fluid, is powerless to modify this result. this fact would seem to be of interest and importance, since it has already been shown that very slight structural changes in the meningeal-choroidal complex suffice to make possible or certain infection under these circumstances. apparently mere augmentation, from time to time, of the secretory functions of the choroid plexus, through intravenous injection of an extract of the choroid plexus and while the virus is still circulating, is insufficient to insure passage of the virus from the blood into the nervous tissues, upon which infection depends. neither does the augmentation exercise a restraining influence on the development of infection otherwise capable of taking place.\n",

      "Abstract: the injection of virulent cultures of bacillus influenzæ into the subdural space of several species of lower monkeys is followed by the development of an acute inflammation of the meninges, corresponding in clinical, bacteriological, and pathological effects with influenzal cerebrospinal meningitis in human beings. experimental influenzal meningitis in the monkey is a lethal disease which terminates fatally in from thirty-six hours to four days after the inoculation. the injected influenza bacilli produce their effects through multiplication in the course of which they penetrate from the subdural space into the general blood current, from which they may be recovered during life and at autopsy, as is also true of the spontaneous form of influenzal meningitis in man. by repeated injection, over a period of many months, of living virulent cultures of bacillus influenzæ into the goat, an immune serum possessing moderate agglutinating and high opsonic power may be produced, which is capable, when injected into the subdural space, of arresting the progress of an experimental influenzal meningitis, and of bringing about recovery in monkeys thus affected. as a result of the serum injections, the influenza bacilli in the meninges are more freely englobed by phagocytes, their number is reduced, their capacity of growth diminished, and the eruption into the blood arrested. along with these effects go, hand in hand, cessation of the local inflammatory process and progressive amelioration of the symptoms of illness, to be followed usually by rapid restoration of health. in view of the highly fatal character of influenzal meningitis in human beings, the employment of an immune serum by subdural injection is recommended. undoubtedly it will be necessary to apply the serum early and by repeated injections, by means of lumbar puncture, to secure beneficial results. the early application will, in turn, be dependent upon prompt bacteriological diagnosis, which can be made, as a rule, by the immediate microscopical examination of the cerebrospinal fluid without the employment of cultural methods. when possible, the microscopical diagnosis should be confirmed by cultural tests.\n",

      "Abstract: bartonella bacilliformis failed to induce lesions when merely rubbed on the surface of the intact skin of a chimpanzee, an ourang-utan, and numerous macacus rhesus monkeys, although when applied to the scarified skin of the same animals it gave rise to extensive lesions. application of infectious material to the scarified skin did not always induce verruga lesions, but intradermal inoculation almost invariably gave rise to nodule formation. the localization of bartonella bacilliformis in the skin is not, in experimental animals, determined by mechanical factors, since scarification of the skin or intradermal injection of foreign substances in monkeys infected with bartonella bacilliformis does not give rise to verruga formation. the degree of susceptibility of the skin tissues appears to be considerably diminished during the course of experimental infection with bartonella bacilliformis. inoculation of the scarified skin of infected animals gave uniformly negative results, and intradermal inoculation induced only a mild local reaction. in a few exceptional instances, however, of animals previously infected with the strain of bartonella bacilliformis derived from a human verruga nodule, reinoculation with the same strain gave rise to unusually marked reactions. the evolution of the skin lesion induced in experimental animals by bartonella bacilliformis may be divided into four stages, the period of incubation, the initial stage, the mature and vascular stage, and the regression. in the initial stage the lesion is a pure angioendothelioma, but in the stage of full development the histological picture is complicated by connective tissue proliferation and occasionally also by penetration of epidermis into the lesion. the demonstration of bartonella bacilliformis in the endothelial cells distinguishes the lesion from others which simulate it. the cutaneous lesions known as verruga nodular, verruga mular, and verruga miliar have been reproduced in monkeys.\n",

      "Abstract: twelve normal monkeys inoculated on the mucous membranes of the nose or nose and mouth with a strain of bacillus influenzæ; originally isolated in pure culture from the pleural exudate of a case of empyema following influenzal pneumonia in man and subsequently raised in virulence by animal passage, developed an acute self-limited respiratory disease of from 3 to 5 days duration, characterized by sudden onset with profound prostration, the development of rhinitis and tracheobronchitis, with sneezing, cough, and the outpouring of a scanty mucoid, or mucopurulent exudate, a variable febrile reaction, and either a leucopenia or no significant change in the leucocyte count. this disease was complicated in five instances by purulent sinusitis of one or both antra, in three by bronchopneumonia. bacillus influenzæ was recovered at autopsy from the lesions of the disease either in pure culture or in association with organisms that are normal inhabitants of the upper respiratory tract of monkeys. of ten normal monkeys injected intratracheally with the same strain of bacillus influenzæ, seven developed bronchopneumonia, two developed tracheobronchitis without pneumonia, and one resisted infection. the general symptoms and duration of the disease were similar to those of the preceding group. there were a severe cough and accelerated respirations. bacillus influenzæ was recovered in pure culture from the lungs, bronchi, or trachea in the animals killed during the active stage of the disease. it disappeared promptly from the respiratory tract with recovery. the significance of the first series of experiments in which monkeys were inoculated in the upper respiratory tract is twofold. first, they establish the fact that bacillus influenzæ can initiate in monkeys an acute infection of the normal mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract; that is, it can act as a primary incitant of respiratory infection without the assistance of a preceding or concomitant contributing cause. in this respect it differs radically from the pneumococcus and streptococcus hæmolyticus, since experiments previously reported2, 4 have shown that neither of these organisms possesses the property of initiating an infection of the normal mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract of monkeys, even though the strains used were incalculably more virulent for monkeys than the strain of bacillus influenzæ used in the foregoing experiments. secondly, the experiments show that bacillus influenzæ infection of the mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract may spread by continuity to the paranasal sinuses, setting up an acute sinusitis, that it spreads readily to the lower respiratory tract, producing a tracheobronchitis and permitting the ready invasion of secondary bacteria, and that it may penetrate as far as the terminal bronchioles, alveolar ducts, atria, and alveoli, there setting up a bronchiolitis and true bronchopneumonia. in these respects it likewise differs radically from the pneumococcus and streptococcus hæmolyticus which do not possess these pathogenic properties as previous experiments have shown.2, 4 the bearing of these facts on the possible etiologic relation of bacillus influenzæ to influenza is important, since they show that bacillus influenzæ possesses certain definite primary pathogenic properties which distinguish it and therefore separate it from the group of recognized secondary organisms in influenzal complications, of which the pneumococcus and the streptococcus are the most frequent. the possible etiologic relation of bacillus influenzæ to influenza is further supported by the character of the respiratory disease that occurred in the monkeys. the sudden onset with profound prostration, the absence of leucocytosis or often a leucopenia, the congestion of the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract, the development on the 2nd or 3rd day of an irritative cough due to an inflammatory tracheitis or tracheobronchitis, the brief self-limited course of the infection, and the irregular febrile reactions are all characteristic of influenza. many of these symptoms were in striking contrast with the symptoms and course of pneumococcus or streptococcus infections in monkeys in which there were no prostration at onset, invariable leucocytosis, and infrequent cough developing only late in the disease. while all the above features of the disease produced in monkeys are characteristic of influenza in man, none are pathognomonic and, in fact, it is doubtful whether uncomplicated influenza possesses any pathognomonic features by which it may be diagnosed certainly in the absence of an epidemic. even during epidemic times many respiratory infections arise which, though presumably influenza, it is impossible to diagnose as such with certainty. nor does pathology help in this respect, since there would appear to be no established distinctive lesions of uncomplicated influenza in man, nor for that matter of the complications of influenza, apart from the complications which have been ascribed by pfeiffer,5 maccallum,6 wolbach,7 and others to infection with bacillus influenzæ because of the association of bacillus influenzæ in pure culture with these complications. for these reasons, although the disease produced in monkeys appears to be essentially identical with influenza in man with respect to its clinical course and complications, it is impossible to determine certainly whether it is actually so. the experiments are advanced, therefore, as evidence in favor of the etiologic relation of bacillus influenzæ to influenza, though they do not permit of a definite conclusion in this respect. their bearing upon the relation of bacillus influenzæ to certain of the complications of influenza would appear to be reasonably conclusive. the recovery of bacillus influenzæ in pure culture at autopsy from the antra, from the trachea and bronchi, and from the lungs in some of the animals developing sinusitis, bronchiolitis, and a characteristic type of bronchopneumonia confirms by animal experiment the etiologic relation of bacillus influenzæ to these complications of influenza, which hitherto has rested solely upon the frequent association of the influenza bacillus with these lesions in man. the production of tracheobronchitis and the same type of bronchopneumonia by the intratracheal injection of bacillus influenzæ in the second series of experiments serves as additional confirmation of this, but has no direct bearing on the etiologic relation of bacillus influenzæ to uncomplicated influenzæ.\n",

      "Title: experimental immunity with reference to the bacillus of leprosy \n",
      "Abstract: repeated experiments have proven that few, if any, of the ordinary laboratory and domestic animals are immune against infection by bacillus lepræ. as previously reported, the goat, horse, guinea pig, and many cold-blooded animals (couret) have been found susceptible to invasion by this organism. two factors are of great importance in effecting infection. in the first place, a sufficiently large number of organisms must be employed, and, what is still more important, second and subsequent inoculations are more liable to produce leprous lesions than are primary injections. moderate doses used in the first inoculation of animals are comparatively harmless as regards their ability to induce lesions. such preliminary doses, whether they consist of living or dead organisms, produce a condition of hypersensitiveness or allergy, which renders it possible by a second injection of viable bacilli to induce the development of a reactionary lesion. lesions arising as the result of a second inoculation develop more rapidly, increase in size more quickly, and persist for a longer period than those taking place as the result of a single inoculation, even though very large doses are used. moreover, the bacilli in these lesions are more liable to lead to metastasis and to a generalized infection. we regard the results of these experiments as having considerable bearing upon the development of the disease in human cases, since we find that it is chiefly among those living in prolonged intimate contact with leprous patients that leprosy develops. the proper interpretation of these findings is difficult and becomes, apparently, more complex the longer they are studied. we are accustomed to similar phenomena of anaphylaxis or allergy with protein materials and with certain bacteria, especially the tubercle bacillus. it is not surprising that a specific allergy or altered reaction should take place in animals previously injected with leprosy bacilli, either alive or dead; why, however, lesions should develop in which the bacilli continue to grow in animals which had recovered from previous injections, or the serum of which showed bactericidal properties and contained other specific antibodies, is not so easily understood. it is unnecessary in this paper to discuss the relative value of the different theories brought forward to explain the phenomenon of anaphylaxis. it must, nevertheless, be assumed that either as the result of the splitting of certain essentially non-toxic substances in the bacillus by specific ferment-like substances in the blood, which increase after a sensitizing dose, or by the joining of some body in the serum with certain substances in the bacilli, a toxic body is produced. following the setting free or development of these injurious bodies, there results a cellular reaction, an area of local necrosis followed usually by the appearance of cells of the lymphoid and epithelioid type, and, especially if dead bacilli are used, by polymorphonuclear leucocytes. such a reaction is usual in all allergic or anaphylactic conditions; but why the reaction should pre-dispose to the more or less permanent development of parasitic powers on the part of the bacilli is not so plain. the idea has been expressed by us, as the result of observations based chiefly upon the study of the changes in the tissues of human leprosy, that the presence of bacilli within the large multinucleated cells that are characteristic of the lesion is the result of active multiplication of the bacilli in these cells rather than of phagocytosis by the cells, although it is possible that their original entrance may be the result of phagocytic action. if this be the case, it is possible that, through the cellular reaction plus the necrosis of certain of the fixed tissue cells, a pabulum of split protein products results upon which the bacilli feed, and in which they find protection from the antibodies present in the blood serum. in our attempts to induce infection in various mammalian species with cultures of human leprosy, positive results have been obtained in almost every instance after the second injection of large numbers of the organism. in this manner, we have been successful in the production of lesions in the monkey, goat, horse, guinea pig, and mouse. the results of these experiments lead us to believe that the mechanism through which invasion and multiplication follows in these lower animals is similar to if not identical with that in man. a careful study of the progress of the disease in man together with the behavior of the organism in the monkey and the goat would suggest, at least, that the function of toxin production is, after all, of little use to the leprosy bacillus because it has seemingly acquired a highly parasitic existence; instead of which it is not only possible, but highly probable, that its defensive protection, whatever it may be, is enormously developed. after the inoculation of animals with either dead or living bacilli, the production of specific antibodies is induced; these do not develop in any considerable amount and apparently show no marked tendency to increase upon repeated injections. the tests of the sera in vitro indicate that the antisubstances are produced chiefly by the first few injections. either the existence of some specific bacterial protective body, or what seems more probable, the protection afforded by the host cells in which the bacilli become ensconsed accounts, we believe, for the difficulty of producing in animals an antiserum of high potency. the idea, too, that the bacilli do not multiply to any great extent until they have entered certain cells of the host has, in a large measure, been verified by the artificial cultivation experiments. we know from our studies upon the biology of the organism that it will live for years in the most unfavorable conditions. this would suggest that during their sojourn in the tissue cells death as the result of autolysis rarely occurs, and as long as the cells can withstand the multiplication of the bacilli within and remain alive, so long are the bacilli protected from outside injurious influences, in consequence of which no disintegration of bacilli occurs to induce the production of immune bodies. on the other hand, death of the cells carrying the bacilli must occur from time to time, and this exposes large numbers of the organisms to the action of the body fluids, and, in consequence, to the condition of formation of specific antibodies.\n",

      "Title: strongyloides infections in man and animals in the isthmian canal zone\n",
      "Abstract: from a study of strongyloides infections in man and animals in this region, it has been determined, in confirmation of the view of grassi, calmette, and others, that they are not causative factors in the production of diarrhea. the mother worm, however, burrows into the mucosa and deposits her ova there. certain tissue reactions take place and are evidenced by the cellular proliferation in those portions of the intestines occupied by the nematodes. in animals, there is an associated anemia, not positively attributable to the strongyloides, but, on the other hand, not attributable to any other cause. it is possible that s. stercoralis may cause some degree of anemia in man. the amount is indeterminable in this region among hospital cases on account of the associated hookworm disease or malaria. portals of entry for various microörganisms are made by the female mother worm and her larvæ in the small intestine, and, while no case of general bacterial infection has been proved to have arisen in this way, its occurrence is possible and highly probable. in the cultures of strongyloides of man, there is among natives, who presumably are infected with purely tropical strains, a very marked predominance of development by the indirect or sexually differentiated mode, in some cases, an absolutely pure culture of the indirect mode larvæ being obtained. there are, however, natives, cultures from whose stools contain from a single filariform larva of the direct phase up to a very definite predominance of this mode. cultures from natives of the temperate zones contain a marked predominance of the direct phase larvæ. the presence of the filariform (direct mode), larva is perhaps best accounted for by its being an attempt at more perfect parasitism (stiles). from a correlation of culture study with the results of a histological examination of the invaded mucosa, this explanation of the derivation of the two phases is suggested. the mother worm in the intestinal tract has two kinds of progeny: (a) those expelled into the crypts or lumen, and (b) those imbedded in the intestinal wall. one lot becomes larvæ of either the direct or indirect phase; the other lot of the opposite phase. it appears to me that the intraepithelial cell-developed larvæ furnish the direct phase, while the embryos expelled directly from the mother become the indirect phase larvæ. this will require for its confirmation a study of cultures in connection with a histological examination of the infected intestinal wall. cold merely inhibits the development of the larvγaelig; into either the filariform (direct) or into the sexually differentiated adults, and does not alter the anlage. the resistant as well as the infecting form is the filariform larva, and all chemical larvicides must be directed against this form. thymol and an alkaline cresol resin soap were found to be effective larvicides for the filariform larvæ. two new strongyloides of the monkey and ant bear are described. cultures of these nematodes show a predominance of the indirect mode of development.\n",

      "Abstract: 1. the subcutaneous injection of small doses of living virulent pneumococcus type i stimulates in monkeys a degree of active immunity sufficient to protect them against experimental pneumococcus pneumonia of homologous type. 2. the subcutaneous injection of living avirulent pneumococcus type i, if administered in a sufficiently large dose, likewise renders the monkey immune to a subsequent pneumonia of homologous type. 3. vaccination of monkeys with small doses of living virulent pneumococci may or may not be followed by a severe constitutional reaction, depending on the natural resistance of the individual. the severe reactions are caused by the development of a pneumococcus septicemia. which is either temporary, or leads to a fatal termination. the mild reactions are not accompanied by septicemia, and there are no symptoms other than a slight elevation of temperature and moderate leucocytosis. vaccination with living avirulent pneumococci does not induce severe reactions and is not accompanied by pneumococcus septicemia. 4. active immunity against pneumococcus pneumonia, produced by vaccination with living pneumococci, appears to be largely independent of the presence or absence of agglutinins and protective bodies in the serum of the monkey. 5. vaccination with living cultures of pneumococcus type i confers against other types of pneumococci a certain amount of cross-immunity which, however, varies considerably with the individual monkey. 6. immunity against pneumococcus, like other forms of immunity, is a relative term, and depends upon the capacity of the individual for antibody production, the virulence of the invading microorganism, and the size of the dose injected.\n",

      "Abstract: purpose\n",
      "high oxygen consumption and cyclical changes related to dark-adaptation are characteristic of the outer retina. oxygenation changes may contribute to the selective vulnerability of the retina in retinitis pigmentosa (rp) patients, especially for those forms involving genes with global cellular functions. genes coding for components of the u4/u6.u5 tri small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (tri-snrnp) complex of the spliceosome stand out, because mutations in four genes cause rp, i.e., rp9 (pap1), rp11 (prpf31), rp13 (prpf8), and rp18 (prpf3), while there is no degeneration outside the retina despite global expression of these genes. with the assumption that variable oxygenation plays a role in rp forms related to pre-mrna splicing and the retina and brain are similar, we searched a data collection of ischemia-hypoxia regulated genes of the brain for oxygen regulated genes of the u4/u6.u5 tri-snrnp complex.\n",
      "methods\n",
      "a database of ischemia-hypoxia response (ihr) genes in the brain was generated from gene expression profiling studies [n=24]. public databases (ncbi) were searched for rp genes with global function that are expressed in the brain. from the ihr gene list, we extracted genes that were directly related to retinal degeneration through a listed mutation (omim, retnet, risn). the database was then examined for indirect links to rp forms affecting the u4/u6.u5 tri-snrnp complex by searching for ihr genes contributing to this complex. potential expression of matched genes in the retina was ascertained using neibank. immunohistochemistry was used to localize a selected protein of the u4/u6.u5 tri-snrnp complex in cynomolgus monkey and human retina specimens.\n",
      "results\n",
      "the approach identified genes that cause retinal degeneration (cngb1, sema4a, rrg4) or developmental changes (sox2) when mutated. one ihr gene, pim1, is the immediate binding partner for pap1 (rp9). three ihr genes linked the u4/u6.u5 tri-snrnp complex to regulation by oxygenation: prpf4; sart1, also known as 110 kda sr-related protein of the u4/u6.u5 tri-snrnp or as hypoxia associated factor (haf); and lsm8, u6 snrna-associated sm-like protein. the 110 kda sr-related protein was localized in all retinal cells including photoreceptors.\n",
      "conclusions\n",
      "regulation by changes in oxygenation within the u4/u6.u5 tri-snrp complex could be particularly important for photoreceptors where oxygen consumption follows a circadian rhythm. if the u4/u6.u5 tri-snrp complex is already impaired by mutations in any of the four genes causing rp, it may be unable to follow properly the physiological demands of oxygenation which are mediated by the four hypoxia-regulated proteins emerging in this study. selective vulnerability may involve complex combinations of widely expressed genes, specific cellular functions and local energy availability.\n",

      "Abstract: the potential use of variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, as a bioweapon and the endemic presence of monkeypox virus in africa demonstrate the need for better therapies for orthopoxvirus infections. chemotherapeutic approaches to control viral infections have been less successful than those targeting bacterial infections. while bacteria commonly reproduce themselves outside of cells and have metabolic functions against which antibiotics can be directed, viruses replicate in the host cells using the cells' metabolic pathways. this makes it very difficult to selectively target the virus without damaging the host. therefore, the development of antiviral drugs against poxviruses has initially focused on unique properties of the viral replication cycle or of viral proteins that can be selectively targeted. however, recent advances in molecular biology have provided insights into host factors that represent novel drug targets. the latest anti-poxvirus drugs are kinase inhibitors, which were originally developed to treat cancer progression but in addition block egress of poxviruses from infected cells. this review will summarize the current understanding of anti-poxvirus drugs and will give an overview of the development of the latest second generation poxvirus drugs.\n",

      "Abstract: ebola viruses are highly lethal human pathogens that have received considerable attention in recent years due to an increasing re-emergence in central africa and a potential for use as a biological weapon. there is no vaccine or treatment licensed for human use. in the past, however, important advances have been made in developing preventive vaccines that are protective in animal models. in this regard, we showed that a single injection of a live-attenuated recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vector expressing the ebola virus glycoprotein completely protected rodents and nonhuman primates from lethal ebola challenge. in contrast, progress in developing therapeutic interventions against ebola virus infections has been much slower and there is clearly an urgent need to develop effective post-exposure strategies to respond to future outbreaks and acts of bioterrorism, as well as to treat laboratory exposures. here we tested the efficacy of the vesicular stomatitis virus-based ebola vaccine vector in post-exposure treatment in three relevant animal models. in the guinea pig and mouse models it was possible to protect 50% and 100% of the animals, respectively, following treatment as late as 24 h after lethal challenge. more important, four out of eight rhesus macaques were protected if treated 20 to 30 min following an otherwise uniformly lethal infection. currently, this approach provides the most effective post-exposure treatment strategy for ebola infections and is particularly suited for use in accidentally exposed individuals and in the control of secondary transmission during naturally occurring outbreaks or deliberate release.being highly pathogenic for humans and monkeys and the subject of former weapons programs makes ebola virus one of the most feared pathogens worldwide today. due to a lack of licensed pre- and post-exposure intervention, our current response depends on rapid diagnostics, proper isolation procedures, and supportive care of case patients. consequently, the development of more specific countermeasures is of high priority for the preparedness of many nations. in this study, we investigated an attenuated vesicular stomatitis virus expressing the ebola virus surface glycoprotein, which had previously demonstrated convincing efficacy as a vaccine against ebola infections in rodents and monkeys, for its potential use in the treatment of an ebola virus infection. surprisingly, treatment of guinea pigs and mice as late as 24 h after lethal ebola virus infection resulted in 50% and 100% survival, respectively. more important, 50% of rhesus macaques (4/8) were protected if treated 20 to 30 min after ebola virus infection. currently, this approach provides the most effective treatment strategy for ebola infections and seems particularly suited for the use in accidental exposures and the control of human-to-human transmission during outbreaks.\n",

      "Abstract: current anticholinesterase pesticides were developed during world war ii and are toxic to mammals because they target a catalytic serine residue of acetylcholinesterases (aches) in insects and in mammals. a sequence analysis of aches from 73 species and a three-dimensional model of a malaria-carrying mosquito (anopheles gambiae) ache (agache) reported here show that c286 and r339 of agache are conserved at the opening of the active site of aches in 17 invertebrate and four insect species, respectively. both residues are absent in the active site of aches of human, monkey, dog, cat, cattle, rabbit, rat, and mouse. the 17 invertebrates include house mosquito, japanese encephalitis mosquito, african malaria mosquito, german cockroach, florida lancelet, rice leaf beetle, african bollworm, beet armyworm, codling moth, diamondback moth, domestic silkworm, honey bee, oat or wheat aphid, the greenbug, melon or cotton aphid, green peach aphid, and english grain aphid. the four insects are house mosquito, japanese encephalitis mosquito, african malaria mosquito, and german cockroach. the discovery of the two invertebrate-specific residues enables the development of effective and safer pesticides that target the residues present only in mosquito aches rather than the ubiquitous serine residue, thus potentially offering an effective control of mosquito-borne malaria. anti-agache pesticides can be designed to interact with r339 and subsequently covalently bond to c286. such pesticides would be toxic to mosquitoes but not to mammals.\n",

      "Abstract: perinatal environmental tobacco smoke (ets) exposure in humans elicits neurobehavioral deficits. we exposed rhesus monkeys to ets during gestation and through 13 months postnatally, or postnatally only (6–13 months). at the conclusion of exposure, we examined cerebrocortical regions and the midbrain for cell damage markers and lipid peroxidation. for perinatal ets, two archetypal patterns were seen in the various regions, one characterized by cell loss (reduced dna concentration) and corresponding increases in cell size (increased protein/dna ratio), and a second pattern suggesting replacement of larger neuronal cells with smaller and more numerous glia (increased dna concentration, decreased protein/dna ratio). the membrane/total protein ratio, a biomarker of neurite formation, also indicated potential damage to neuronal projections, accompanied by reactive sprouting. when ets exposure was restricted to the postnatal period, the effects were similar in regional selectivity, direction, and magnitude. these patterns resemble the effects of prenatal nicotine exposure in rodent and primate models. surprisingly, perinatal ets exposure reduced the level of lipid peroxidation as assessed by the concentration of thiobarbituric acid reactive species, whereas postnatal ets did not. the heart, a tissue that, like the brain, has high oxygen demand, displayed a similar but earlier decrease (2–3 months) in lipid peroxidation in the perinatal exposure model, whereas values were reduced at 13 months with the postnatal exposure paradigm. our results provide a mechanistic connection between perinatal ets exposure and neurobehavioral anomalies, reinforce the role of nicotine in these effects, and buttress the importance of restricting or eliminating ets exposure in young children.\n",

      "Abstract: several methods of quantitative risk assessment that have been described recently are particularly applicable to neurotoxic end points. these methods can be broadly divided into two types of approaches based on their treatment of dose-response data to estimate risks. benchmark approaches estimate risks using variability in response to a fixed dose level in comparison with background control variability. probabilistic approaches estimate risks using the variability in the dose to produce a small effect in the sample population. the current report seeks to extend the development of probabilistic approaches for neurotoxic end points. because behavioral data are often used to assess therapeutic efficacy as well as toxicity (unwanted effects), this analysis focused on the relative risks of producing these effects with the same agent. the therapeutic potential of gbr 12909 was determined by its ability to decrease cocaine-maintained responding in monkeys. the effects of this agent were also assessed in the same monkeys using food-maintained responding to provide an indication of behavioral toxicity. gbr 12909 decreased both behaviors, with complete decreases on drug-seeking behavior occurring at doses that had minimal effects on food-maintained responding. the difference in the estimates of doses to decrease drug-seeking and food-maintained behavior suggested that specific therapeutic effects could be obtained in the absence of unwanted side effects for a definable proportion of the population. these results also suggest that multiple behavioral end points can be useful for identifying specific effects of chemicals for the purposes' of risk assessment.\n",

      "Title: immune protection of nonhuman primates against ebola virus with single low-dose adenovirus vectors encoding modified gps\n",
      "Abstract: background\n",
      "ebola virus causes a hemorrhagic fever syndrome that is associated with high mortality in humans. in the absence of effective therapies for ebola virus infection, the development of a vaccine becomes an important strategy to contain outbreaks. immunization with dna and/or replication-defective adenoviral vectors (rad) encoding the ebola glycoprotein (gp) and nucleoprotein (np) has been previously shown to confer specific protective immunity in nonhuman primates. gp can exert cytopathic effects on transfected cells in vitro, and multiple gp forms have been identified in nature, raising the question of which would be optimal for a human vaccine.\n",
      "methods and findings\n",
      "to address this question, we have explored the efficacy of mutant gps from multiple ebola virus strains with reduced in vitro cytopathicity and analyzed their protective effects in the primate challenge model, with or without np. deletion of the gp transmembrane domain eliminated in vitro cytopathicity but reduced its protective efficacy by at least one order of magnitude. in contrast, a point mutation was identified that abolished this cytopathicity but retained immunogenicity and conferred immune protection in the absence of np. the minimal effective rad dose was established at 1010 particles, two logs lower than that used previously.\n",
      "conclusions\n",
      "expression of specific gps alone vectored by rad are sufficient to confer protection against lethal challenge in a relevant nonhuman primate model. elimination of np from the vaccine and dose reductions to 1010 rad particles do not diminish protection and simplify the vaccine, providing the basis for selection of a human vaccine candidate.\n",
      "background.\n",
      "humans who get infected with ebola virus develop an illness called ebola hemorrhagic fever (ehv), which is one of the most deadly viral diseases known; 50%–90% of all ill patients die, and there is no available treatment for ehv. scientists think that the occasional outbreaks of the disease occur because the virus “jumps” from an infected animal to a person (a rare event) and then is transmitted between people by direct contact with infected blood or other body fluids or parts. several strains or variants of the ebola virus exist. most outbreaks have been caused either by the zaire strain or by the sudan/gulu strain (so-called because that is where the particular virus was first isolated). scientists are working on a vaccine against ebola that could be given to people before they get infected and then protect them when they come in contact with the virus. a number of candidate vaccines have been developed and tested in animals.\n",
      "why was this study done?\n",
      "the researchers who did this study are working on a vaccine that consists of two particular parts of the virus. one part is called gp (which stands for glycoprotein) and is from the outer coat of the virus; the other, np (nucleoprotein), is from its inside. without the rest of the virus, gp and np cannot cause ebv. however, the hope is that giving these parts of the virus to an individual can educate their immune system to build a response against gp and np, which would then recognize the virus should the vaccinated person become infected with the whole virus, and destroy it before it can cause disease. to get the gp and np parts into the body so that they can cause a strong immune response (which is what effective vaccines do), the researchers used a manmade version of another, harmless virus called recombinant adenovirus 5 (or rad5) to carry the np and gp. the researchers have shown previously that this strategy for introducing a vaccine works in animals. the vaccine—i.e., the combination of the rad5 virus and the two ebola virus parts—can protect animals against subsequent infection with real ebola virus that would otherwise kill them. however, during these earlier studies, the researchers had noticed that the gp part, when present at high levels, seemed to make human cells sick. they had not seen any similar problems in the experimental animals, but to be on the safe side they decided to see whether they could change the gp part so that it would still be effective as a vaccine but no longer make human cells sick.\n",
      "what did the researchers do and find?\n",
      "they changed the gp part of the vaccine in different ways so that it would no longer make human cells sick and then tested whether the resulting vaccines (combined with the original np part and the ad5 virus) could still protect monkeys from ehf after they were infected with ebola virus. they found that some of the new gp versions made the vaccine less effective, but others did what they had hoped for; namely, they gave the same level of protection as when the original gp part was present. while doing these experiments, the researchers also found that the np component seemed unnecessary and in some cases even weakened the vaccine's effect.\n",
      "what do these findings mean?\n",
      "the researchers have now developed a simplified vaccine against ebola virus that is effective in monkeys. this vaccine consists of only a modified gp component (which is well tolerated by human cells even at high concentrations) and the rad5 component. this vaccine is not the only candidate currently being developed against ebola, but it seems likely that it is one of a few that will be tested in human volunteers in the near future. the initial clinical trials will test whether the vaccine is safe in humans, and whether it can cause the immune system to produce an immune response that is specific for the ebola virus. assuming that the outcomes of these trials are positive, the next question is whether the vaccine can protect humans against ebola disease. because ebola is so dangerous and outbreaks are relatively rare, the vaccine will likely be tested only during an actual outbreak. at that time, an experimental vaccine might be given to people at immediate risk of becoming infected, especially health-care workers who, because they take care of infected patients, are themselves at very high risk of becoming infected. in addition to trials in humans, the scientists will also explore whether this vaccine, which was developed based on the gp component of the zaire strain, can protect monkeys against infections with other strains of the ebola virus.\n",

      "Abstract: enormous effort has been focused over the last decade and a half on characterizing the behavioral effects of lead in the developing organism. while age-appropriate standardized measures of intelligence (iq) have been the dependent variable most often used to assess lead-induced cognitive impairment in epidemiologic studies, researchers have also used a variety of other methods designed to assess specific behavioral processes sensitive to lead. increased reaction time and poorer performance on vigilance tasks associated with increased lead body burden suggest increased distractibility and short attention span. assessment of behavior on teachers' rating scales identified increased distractibility, impulsivity, nonpersistence, inability to follow sequences of directions, and inappropriate approach to problems as hallmarks of lead exposure. robust deficits in learned skills such as reading, spelling, math, and word recognition have also been found. spatial organizational perception and abilities seem particularly sensitive to lead-induced impairment. assessment of complex tasks of learning and memory in both rats and monkeys has revealed overall deficits in function over a variety of behavioral tasks. exploration of behavioral mechanisms responsible for these deficits identified increased distractibility perseveration, inability to inhibit inappropriate responding, and inability to change response strategy as underlying deficits. thus, there is remarkable congruence between the epidemiologic and experimental literatures with regard to the behavioral processes identified as underlying the deficits inflicted by developmental lead exposure. however, careful behavioral analysis was required from researchers in both fields for such understanding to emerge.\n",

      "Abstract: variation in genes underlying host immunity can lead to marked differences in susceptibility to hiv infection among humans. despite heavy reliance on non-human primates as models for hiv/aids, little is known about which host factors are shared and which are unique to a given primate lineage. here, we investigate whether copy number variation (cnv) at ccl3-like genes (ccl3l), a key genetic host factor for hiv/aids susceptibility and cell-mediated immune response in humans, is also a determinant of time until onset of simian-aids in rhesus macaques. using a retrospective study of 57 rhesus macaques experimentally infected with sivmac, we find that ccl3l cnv explains approximately 18% of the variance in time to simian-aids (p<0.001) with lower ccl3l copy number associating with more rapid disease course. we also find that ccl3l copy number varies significantly (p<10−6) among rhesus subpopulations, with indian-origin macaques having, on average, half as many ccl3l gene copies as chinese-origin macaques. lastly, we confirm that ccl3l shows variable copy number in humans and chimpanzees and report on ccl3l cnv within and among three additional primate species. on the basis of our findings we suggest that (1) the difference in population level copy number may explain previously reported observations of longer post-infection survivorship of chinese-origin rhesus macaques, (2) stratification by ccl3l copy number in rhesus siv vaccine trials will increase power and reduce noise due to non-vaccine-related differences in survival, and (3) ccl3l cnv is an ancestral component of the primate immune response and, therefore, copy number variation has not been driven by hiv or siv per se.development of vaccines for hiv/aids is a pressing global issue. the rhesus monkey remains the primary model for testing potential human vaccines; however, little is known about similarities and differences in host genes involved in hiv/aids response in humans and rhesus monkeys. understanding these similarities and/or differences should allow more efficient testing of vaccines beneficial to humans. here we describe the role that variation in the number of copies of ccl3-like genes (ccl3l) plays in siv progression rates in rhesus monkeys. copy number variation (cnv) of these genes has previously been shown to play a role in susceptibility and progression of hiv in humans. our results suggest that individual monkeys with lower ccl3l copy number progress more rapidly. accounting for ccl3l cnv in rhesus vaccine trials will improve researchers' abilities to interpret survival data.\n",

      "Abstract: background\n",
      "understanding the evolutionary origins of a phenotype requires understanding the relationship between ontogenetic and phylogenetic processes. human infants have been shown to undergo a process of perceptual narrowing during their first year of life, whereby their intersensory ability to match the faces and voices of another species declines as they get older. we investigated the evolutionary origins of this behavioral phenotype by examining whether or not this developmental process occurs in non-human primates as well.\n",
      "methodology/principal findings\n",
      "we tested the ability of infant vervet monkeys (cercopithecus aethiops), ranging in age from 23 to 65 weeks, to match the faces and voices of another non-human primate species (the rhesus monkey, macaca mulatta). even though the vervets had no prior exposure to rhesus monkey faces and vocalizations, our findings show that infant vervets can, in fact, recognize the correspondence between rhesus monkey faces and voices (but indicate that they do so by looking at the non-matching face for a greater proportion of overall looking time), and can do so well beyond the age of perceptual narrowing in human infants. our results further suggest that the pattern of matching by vervet monkeys is influenced by the emotional saliency of the face+voice combination. that is, although they looked at the non-matching screen for face+voice combinations, they switched to looking at the matching screen when the voice was replaced with a complex tone of equal duration. furthermore, an analysis of pupillary responses revealed that their pupils showed greater dilation when looking at the matching natural face/voice combination versus the face/tone combination.\n",
      "conclusions/significance\n",
      "because the infant vervets in the current study exhibited cross-species intersensory matching far later in development than do human infants, our findings suggest either that intersensory perceptual narrowing does not occur in old world monkeys or that it occurs later in development. we argue that these findings reflect the faster rate of neural development in monkeys relative to humans and the resulting differential interaction of this factor with the effects of early experience.\n",

      "Abstract: a recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 (rad5) vector-based vaccine for hiv-1 has recently failed in a phase 2b efficacy study in humans1, 2. consistent with these results, preclinical studies have demonstrated that rad5 vectors expressing siv gag failed to reduce peak or setpoint viral loads following siv challenge of rhesus monkeys that lacked the protective mhc class i allele mamu-a*013. here we show that an improved t cell-based vaccine regimen utilizing two serologically distinct adenovirus vectors afforded substantially improved protective efficacy in this stringent challenge model. in particular, a heterologous rad26 prime, rad5 boost vaccine regimen expressing siv gag elicited cellular immune responses with augmented magnitude, breadth, and polyfunctionality as compared with the homologous rad5 regimen. following sivmac251 challenge, monkeys vaccinated with the heterologous rad26/rad5 regimen exhibited a 1.4 log reduction of peak and a 2.4 log reduction of setpoint viral loads as well as decreased aids-related mortality as compared with control animals. these data demonstrate that durable partial immune control of a pathogenic siv challenge for over 500 days can be achieved by a t cell-based vaccine in mamu-a*01-negative rhesus monkeys in the absence of a homologous env antigen. these findings have important implications for the development of next generation t cell-based vaccine candidates for hiv-1.\n",

      "Abstract: previous work has demonstrated that the xenopus protooncogene mosxe can induce the maturation of prophase-arrested xenopus oocytes. recently, we showed that mosxe can transform murine nih3t3 fibroblasts, although it exhibited only 1-2% of the transforming activity of the v-mos oncogene. in this study we have investigated the ability of the v-mos protein to substitute for the mosxe protein in stimulating xenopus oocytes to complete meiosis. microinjection of in vitro synthesized rnas encoding either the mosxe or v-mos proteins stimulates resting oocytes to undergo germinal vesicle breakdown. microinjection of an antisense oligonucleotide spanning the initiation codon of the mosxe gene blocked progesterone-induced oocyte maturation. when oocytes were microinjected first with the mosxe antisense oligonucleotide, and subsequently with in vitro synthesized v-mos rna, meiotic maturation was rescued as evidenced by germinal vesicle breakdown. the v-mos protein exhibited in vitro kinase activity when recovered by immunoprecipitation from either microinjected xenopus oocytes or transfected monkey cos-1 cells; however, in parallel experiments, we were unable to detect in vitro kinase activity associated with the mosxe protein. microinjection of in vitro synthesized v-mos rna into cleaving xenopus embryos resulted in mitotic arrest, demonstrating that the v-mos protein can function like the mosxe protein as a component of cytostatic factor. these results exemplify the apparently conflicting effects of the v-mos protein, namely, its ability to induce maturation of oocytes, its ability to arrest mitotic cleavage of xenopus embryo, and its ability to transform mammalian fibroblasts.\n",

      "Abstract: interstitial retinol-binding protein (irbp) is a soluble glycoprotein in the interphotoreceptor matrix of bovine, human, monkey, and rat eyes. it may transport retinol between the retinal pigment epithelium and the neural retina. in light-reared royal college of surgeons (rcs) and rcs retinal dystrophy gene (rdy)+ rats, the amount of irbp in the interphotoreceptor matrix increased in corresponding proportion to the amount of total rhodopsin through postnatal day 22 (p22). in the rcs- rdy+ rats, the amount increased slightly after p23. however, in the rcs rats there was a rapid fall in the quantity of irbp as the photoreceptors degenerated between p23 and p29. no irbp was detected by immunocytochemistry in rats at p28. the amount of rhodopsin fell more slowly. although retinas from young rcs and rcs-rdy+ rats were able to synthesize and secrete irbp, this ability was lost in retinas from older rcs rats (p51, p88) but not their congenic controls. the photoreceptor cells have degenerated at these ages in the rcs animals, and may therefore be the retinal cells responsible for irbp synthesis. the putative function of irbp in the extracellular transport of retinoids during the visual cycle is consistent with a defect in retinol transport in the rcs rat reported by others.\n",

      "Abstract: vaccination with plasmodium falciparum msp142/complete freund's adjuvant (fa) followed by msp142/incomplete fa is the only known regimen that protects aotus nancymaae monkeys against infection by erythrocytic stage malaria parasites. the role of adjuvant is not defined; however complete fa cannot be used in humans. in rodent models, immunity is strain-specific. we vaccinated aotus monkeys with the fvo or 3d7 alleles of msp142 expressed in escherichia coli or with the fvo allele expressed in baculovirus (bv) combined with complete and incomplete fa, montanide isa-720 (isa-720) or as02a. challenge with fvo strain p. falciparum showed that suppression of cumulative day 11 parasitemia was strain-specific and could be induced by e. coli expressed msp142 in combination with fa or isa-720 but not with as02a. the coli42-fvo antigen induced a stronger protective effect than the bv42-fvo antigen, and fa induced a stronger protective effect than isa-720. elisa antibody (ab) responses at day of challenge (doc) were strain-specific and correlated inversely with c-day 11 parasitemia (r = −0.843). elisa ab levels at doc meeting a titer of at least 115,000 elisa ab units identified the vaccinees not requiring treatment (notx) with a true positive rate of 83.3% and false positive rate of 14.3 %. correlation between functional growth inhibitory ab levels (gia) and cumulative day 11 parasitemia was weaker (r = −0.511), and was not as predictive for a response of notx. the lowest false positive rate for gia was 30% when requiring a true positive rate of 83.3%. these inhibition results along with those showing that antigen/fa combinations induced a stronger protective immunity than antigen/isa-720 or antigen/as02 combinations are consistent with protection as ascribed to msp1-specific cytophilic antibodies. development of an effective msp142 vaccine against erythrocytic stage p. falciparum infection will depend not only on antigen quality, but also upon the selection of an optimal adjuvant component.\n",

      "Abstract: a previous electron microscopic study of the cat testis revealed that spermatids derived from the same spermatogonium are joined together by intercellular bridges. the present paper records the observation of similar connections between spermatocytes and between spermatids in hydra, fruit-fly, opossum, pigeon, rat, hamster, guinea pig, rabbit, monkey, and man. in view of these findings, it is considered likely that a syncytial relationship within groups of developing male germ cells is of general occurrence and is probably responsible for their synchronous differentiation. when clusters of spermatids, freshly isolated from the germinal epithelium are observed by phase contrast microscopy, the constrictions between the cellular units of the syncytium disappear and the whole group coalesces into a spherical multinucleate mass. the significance of this observation in relation to the occurrence of abnormal spermatozoa in semen and the prevalence of multinucleate giant cells in pathological testes is discussed. in the ectoderm of hydra, the clusters of cnidoblasts that arise from proliferation of interstitial cells are also connected by intercellular bridges. the development of nematocysts within these groups of conjoined cells is precisely synchronized. both in the testis of vertebrates and the ectoderm of hydra, a syncytium results from incomplete cytokinesis in the proliferation of relatively undifferentiated cells. the intercellular bridges between daughter cells are formed when the cleavage furrow encounters the spindle remnant and is arrested by it. the subsequent dissolution of the spindle filaments establishes free communication between the cells. the discovery of intercellular bridges in the two unrelated tissues discussed here suggests that a similar syncytial relationship may be found elsewhere in nature where groups of cells of common origin differentiate synchronously.\n",

      "Abstract: thimerosal is a preservative that has been used in manufacturing vaccines since the 1930s. reports have indicated that infants can receive ethylmercury (in the form of thimerosal) at or above the u.s. environmental protection agency guidelines for methylmercury exposure, depending on the exact vaccinations, schedule, and size of the infant. in this study we compared the systemic disposition and brain distribution of total and inorganic mercury in infant monkeys after thimerosal exposure with those exposed to mehg. monkeys were exposed to mehg (via oral gavage) or vaccines containing thimerosal (via intramuscular injection) at birth and 1, 2, and 3 weeks of age. total blood hg levels were determined 2, 4, and 7 days after each exposure. total and inorganic brain hg levels were assessed 2, 4, 7, or 28 days after the last exposure. the initial and terminal half-life of hg in blood after thimerosal exposure was 2.1 and 8.6 days, respectively, which are significantly shorter than the elimination half-life of hg after mehg exposure at 21.5 days. brain concentrations of total hg were significantly lower by approximately 3-fold for the thimerosal-exposed monkeys when compared with the mehg infants, whereas the average brain-to-blood concentration ratio was slightly higher for the thimerosal-exposed monkeys (3.5 ± 0.5 vs. 2.5 ± 0.3). a higher percentage of the total hg in the brain was in the form of inorganic hg for the thimerosal-exposed monkeys (34% vs. 7%). the results indicate that mehg is not a suitable reference for risk assessment from exposure to thimerosal-derived hg. knowledge of the toxicokinetics and developmental toxicity of thimerosal is needed to afford a meaningful assessment of the developmental effects of thimerosal-containing vaccines.\n",

      "lxrs (liver x receptor α and β) are nuclear receptors that act as ligand-activated transcription factors. lxr activation causes upregulation of genes involved in reverse cholesterol transport (rct), including abca1 and abcg1 transporters, in macrophage and intestine. anti-atherosclerotic effects of synthetic lxr agonists in murine models suggest clinical utility for such compounds.\n",

      "Abstract: ebola virus (ebov) is a significant human pathogen that presents a public health concern as an emerging/re-emerging virus and as a potential biological weapon. substantial progress has been made over the last decade in developing candidate preventive vaccines that can protect nonhuman primates against ebov. among these prospects, a vaccine based on recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (vsv) is particularly robust, as it can also confer protection when administered as a postexposure treatment. a concern that has been raised regarding the replication-competent vsv vectors that express ebov glycoproteins is how these vectors would be tolerated by individuals with altered or compromised immune systems such as patients infected with hiv. this is especially important as all ebov outbreaks to date have occurred in areas of central and western africa with high hiv incidence rates in the population. in order to address this concern, we evaluated the safety of the recombinant vsv vector expressing the zaire ebolavirus glycoprotein (vsvδg/zebovgp) in six rhesus macaques infected with simian-human immunodeficiency virus (shiv). all six animals showed no evidence of illness associated with the vsvδg/zebovgp vaccine, suggesting that this vaccine may be safe in immunocompromised populations. while one goal of the study was to evaluate the safety of the candidate vaccine platform, it was also of interest to determine if altered immune status would affect vaccine efficacy. the vaccine protected 4 of 6 shiv-infected macaques from death following zebov challenge. evaluation of cd4+ t cells in all animals showed that the animals that succumbed to lethal zebov challenge had the lowest cd4+ counts, suggesting that cd4+ t cells may play a role in mediating protection against zebov.ebola virus is among the most lethal microbes known to man, with case fatality rates often exceeding 80%. since its discovery in 1976, outbreaks have been sporadic and geographically restricted, primarily to areas of central africa. however, concern about the natural or unnatural introduction of ebola outside of the endemic areas has dramatically increased both research interest and public awareness. a number of candidate vaccines have been developed to combat ebola virus, and these vaccines have shown varying degrees of success in nonhuman primate models. safety is a significant concern for any vaccine and in particular for vaccines that replicate in the host. here, we evaluated the safety of our replication-competent vesicular stomatitus virus (vsv)-based ebola vaccine in shiv-infected rhesus monkeys. we found that the vaccine caused no evidence of overt illness in any of these immunocompromised animals. we also demonstrated that this vaccine partially protected the shiv-infected monkeys against a lethal ebola challenge and that there appears to be an association with levels of cd4+ lymphocytes and survival. our study suggests that the vsv-based ebola vaccine will be safe in immunocompromised populations and supports further study and development of this promising vaccine platform for its use in humans.\n",

      "Abstract: the control of retroviral infection by antiviral factors referred to as restriction factors has become an exciting area in infectious disease research. trim5α has emerged as an important restriction factor impacting on retroviral replication including hiv-1 replication in primates. trim5α has a tripartite motif comprising ring, b-box and coiled coil domains. the antiviral α splice variant additionally encodes a b30.2 domain which is recruited to incoming viral cores and determines antiviral specificity. trim5 is ubiquitinylated and rapidly turned over by the proteasome in a ring dependent way. protecting restricted virus from degradation, by inhibiting the proteasome, rescues dna synthesis, but not infectivity, indicating that restriction of infectivity by trim5α does not depend on the proteasome but the early block to dna synthesis is likely to be mediated by rapid degradation of the restricted cores. the peptidyl prolyl isomerase enzyme cyclophilin a isomerises a peptide bond on the surface of the hiv-1 capsid and impacts on sensitivity to restriction by trim5α from old world monkeys. this suggests that trim5α from old world monkeys might have a preference for a particular capsid isomer and suggests a role for cyclophilin a in innate immunity in general. whether there are more human antiviral trims remains uncertain although the evidence for trim19's (pml) antiviral properties continues to grow. a trim5-like molecule with broad antiviral activity in cattle suggests that trim mediated innate immunity might be common in mammals. certainly the continued study of restriction of viral infectivity by antiviral host factors will remain of interest to a broad audience and impact on a variety of areas including development of animal models for infection, development of viral vectors for gene therapy and the search for novel antiviral drug targets.\n",

      "Abstract: imitative learning has received great attention due to its supposed role in the development of culture and the cognitive demands it poses on the individual. evidence for imitation in non-human primate species, therefore, could shed light on the early origins of proto-cultural traits in the primate order. imitation has been defined as the learning of an act by seeing it done or, more specifically, as the copying of a novel or otherwise improbable act. but despite a century of research and the detection of mirror neurons the empirical basis for this most advanced form of observational learning is weak. few, if any, studies have shown that the observer has learned the response topography, i.e., the specific action by which the response is made. in an experimental set-up we confronted marmoset monkeys (callithrix jacchus) with a conspecific model that was previously trained to open a plastic box in a peculiar way. employing detailed motion analyses we show that the observers precisely copied the movement patterns of the novel action demonstrated by the model. a discriminant analysis classified 13 out of 14 observer movements (92.86%) as model movements and only one as non-observer movement. this evidence of imitation in non-human primates questions the dominant opinion that imitation is a human-specific ability. furthermore, the high matching degree suggests that marmosets possess the neuronal mechanism to code the actions of others and to map them onto their own motor repertoire, rather than priming existing motor-templates.\n",

      "Abstract: we have investigated the pathogenicity of tsetse (glossina pallidipes)-transmitted cloned strains of trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense in vervet monkeys. tsetse flies were confirmed to have mature trypanosome infections by xenodiagnosis, after which nine monkeys were infected via the bite of a single infected fly. chancres developed in five of the nine (55.6%) monkeys within 4 to 8 days post infection (dpi). all nine individuals were successfully infected, with a median pre-patent period of 4 (range = 4–10) days, indicating that trypanosomes migrated from the site of fly bite to the systemic circulation rapidly and independently of the development of the chancre. the time lag to detection of parasites in cerebrospinal fluid (csf) was a median 16 (range = 8–40) days, marking the onset of central nervous system (cns, late) stage disease. subsequently, csf white cell numbers increased above the pre-infection median count of 2 (range = 0–9) cells/µl, with a positive linear association between their numbers and that of csf trypanosomes. haematological changes showed that the monkeys experienced an early microcytic-hypochromic anaemia and severe progressive thrombocytopaenia. despite a 3-fold increase in granulocyte numbers by 4 dpi, leucopaenia occurred early (8 dpi) in the monkey infection, determined mainly by reductions in lymphocyte numbers. terminally, leucocytosis was observed in three of nine (33%) individuals. the duration of infection was a median of 68 (range = 22–120) days. strain and individual differences were observed in the severity of the clinical and clinical pathology findings, with two strains (ketri 3741 and 3801) producing a more acute disease than the other two (ketri 3804 and 3928). the study shows that the fly-transmitted model accurately mimics the human disease and is therefore a suitable gateway to understanding human african trypanosomiasis (hat; sleeping sickness).sleeping sickness is caused by a species of trypanosome blood parasite that is transmitted by tsetse flies. to understand better how infection with this parasite leads to disease, we provide here the most detailed description yet of the course of infection and disease onset in vervet monkeys. one infected tsetse fly was allowed to feed on each host individual, and in all cases infections were successful. the characteristics of infection and disease were similar in all hosts, but the rate of progression varied considerably. parasites were first detected in the blood 4–10 days after infection, showing that migration of parasites from the site of fly bite was very rapid. anaemia was a key feature of disease, with a reduction in the numbers and average size of red blood cells and associated decline in numbers of platelets and white blood cells. one to six weeks after infection, parasites were observed in the cerebrospinal fluid (csf), indicating that they had moved from the blood into the brain; this was associated with a white cell infiltration. this study shows that fly-transmitted infection in vervets accurately mimics human disease and provides a robust model to understand better how sleeping sickness develops.\n",

      "Abstract: the course of infection of plasmodium fragile in its natural host, the toque monkey macaca sinica, consists of a primary peak of parasitemia followed by several distinct, successive peaks of lower parasitemia. in the s+ host, the late intraerythrocytic asexual developmental stages of p. fragile induce the expression of antigens on the surface of infected erythrocytes, which could be detected using the technique of surface immunofluorescence. immunofluorescence using unfixed erythrocytes in suspension has shown that antigens are recognized by immune serum on the surface of the erythrocytes infected with more mature stages of the parasite. these antigens undergo variation, each successive peak of parasitemia being characterized by a different variant antigenic type (vat). the appearance of the successive vats occurs in a sequential manner, following the same order in different sets of animals. this constitutes the first example of a sequential expression of antigens in a malaria parasite; it indicates that, in p. fragile, antigenic variation is not the result of random mutations selected by antibody. parasite-induced antigens on the surface of infected erythrocytes could not be detected in the s- host. however, when nonexpressing parasites from the s- host were transferred by blood passage into a naive s+ animal, they began to express antigens on the surface of infected erythrocytes within two erythrocytic cycles. we have demonstrated that the ability of s- parasites to switch to a particular vat when passaged into a s+ animal changes during the course of an infection in the s- animal, indicating that, although surface antigens are not expressed, the processes leading to antigenic variation occurs even in the s- host. antibodies directed against these surface antigens inhibit the growth of intra-erythrocytic parasites. the growth inhibition effects of antibodies are also variant specific, indicating that these variant surface antigens are functionally important for parasite survival.\n",

      "we developed a replication-competent vaccine against lassa virus based on attenuated recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vectors expressing the lassa viral glycoprotein. a single intramuscular vaccination of the lassa vaccine elicited a protective immune response in nonhuman primates against a lethal lassa virus challenge. vaccine shedding was not detected in the monkeys, and none of the animals developed fever or other symptoms of illness associated with vaccination. the lassa vaccine induced strong humoral and cellular immune responses in the four vaccinated and challenged monkeys. despite a transient lassa viremia in vaccinated animals 7 d after challenge, the vaccinated animals showed no evidence of clinical disease. in contrast, the two control animals developed severe symptoms including rashes, facial edema, and elevated liver enzymes, and ultimately succumbed to the lassa infection.\n",

      "our data suggest that the lassa vaccine candidate based on recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus is safe and highly efficacious in a relevant animal model that faithfully reproduces human disease.\n",

      "Abstract: models of rheumatoid arthritis (ra) in laboratory animals are important tools for research into pathogenic mechanisms and the development of effective, safe therapies. rodent models (rats and mice) have provided important information about the pathogenic mechanisms. however, the evolutionary distance between rodents and humans hampers the translation of scientific principles into effective therapies. the impact of the genetic distance between the species is especially seen with treatments based on biological molecules, which are usually species-specific. the outbred nature and the closer anatomical, genetic, microbiological, physiological, and immunological similarity of nonhuman primates to humans may help to bridge the wide gap between inbred rodent strain models and the heterogeneous ra patient population. here we review clinical, immunological and pathological aspects of the rhesus monkey model of collagen-induced arthritis, which has emerged as a reproducible model of human ra in nonhuman primates.\n",

      "Abstract: background\n",
      "the neocortical commissures have a fundamental role in functional integration across the cerebral hemispheres. we investigated whether commissural projections in prefrontal cortices are organized according to the same or different rules as those within the same hemisphere, by quantitatively comparing density, topography, and laminar origin of contralateral and ipsilateral projections, labeled after unilateral injection of retrograde tracers in prefrontal areas.\n",
      "results\n",
      "commissural projection neurons constituted less than one third of the ipsilateral. nevertheless, projections from the two hemispheres were strongly correlated in topography and relative density. we investigated to what extent the distribution of contralateral projections depended on: (a) geographic proximity of projection areas to the area homotopic to the injection site; (b) the structural type of the linked areas, based on the number and neuronal density of their layers. although both measures were good predictors, structural type was a comparatively stronger determinant of the relative distribution and density of projections. ipsilateral projection neurons were distributed in the superficial (ii-iii) and deep (v-vi) layers, in proportions that varied across areas. in contrast, contralateral projection neurons were found mostly in the superficial layers, but still showed a gradient in their distribution within cortical layers that correlated significantly with cortical type, but not with geographic proximity to the homotopic area.\n",
      "conclusion\n",
      "the organization of ipsilateral and contralateral prefrontal projections is similar in topography and relative density, differing only by higher overall density and more widespread laminar origin of ipsilateral than contralateral projections. the projections on both sides are highly correlated with the structural architecture of the linked areas, and their remarkable organization is likely established by punctuated development of distinct cortical types. the preponderance of contralateral projections from layer iii may be traced to the late development of the callosal system, whose function may be compromised in diseases that have their root late in ontogeny.\n",

      "Abstract: background\n",
      "the filarial parasites of major importance in humans contain the symbiotic bacterium wolbachia and recent studies have shown that targeting of these bacteria with antibiotics results in a reduction in worm viability, development, embryogenesis, and survival. doxycycline has been effective in human trials, but there is a need to develop drugs that can be given for shorter periods and to pregnant women and children. the world health organisation-approved assay to screen for anti-filarial activity in vitro uses male onchocerca gutturosa, with effects being determined by worm motility and viability as measured by reduction of mtt to mtt formazan. here we have used this system to screen antibiotics for anti-filarial activity. in addition we have determined the contribution of wolbachia depletion to the mtt reduction assay.\n",
      "methods\n",
      "adult male o. gutturosa were cultured on a monkey kidney cell (llcmk 2) feeder layer in 24-well plates with antibiotics and antibiotic combinations (6 to 10 worms per group). the macrofilaricide cgp 6140 (amocarzine) was used as a positive control. worm viability was assessed by two methods, (i) motility levels and (ii) mtt/formazan colorimetry. worm motility was scored on a scale of 0 (immotile) to 10 (maximum) every 5 days up to 40 days. on day 40 worm viability was evaluated by mtt/formazan colorimetry, and results were expressed as a mean percentage reduction compared with untreated control values at day 40. to determine the contribution of wolbachia to the mtt assay, the mtt formazan formation of an insect cell-line (c6/36) with or without insect wolbachia infection and treated or untreated with tetracycline was compared.\n",
      "results\n",
      "antibiotics with known anti-wolbachia activity were efficacious in this system. rifampicin (5 × 10-5m) was the most effective anti-mycobacterial agent; clofazimine (1.25 × 10-5m and 3.13 × 10-6m) produced a gradual reduction in motility and by 40 days had reduced worm viability. the other anti-mycobacterial drugs tested had limited or no activity. doxycycline (5 × 10-5m) was filaricidal, but minocycline was more effective and at a lower concentration (5 × 10-5m and 1.25 × 10-5m). inactive compounds included erythromycin, oxytetracycline, trimethoprim and sulphamethoxazole. the mtt assay on the insect cell-line showed that wolbachia made a significant contribution to the metabolic activity within the cells, which could be reduced when they were exposed to tetracycline.\n",
      "conclusion\n",
      "the o. gutturosa adult male screen for anti-filarial drug activity is also valid for the screening of antibiotics for anti-wolbachia activity. in agreement with previous findings, rifampicin and doxycycline were effective; however, the most active antibiotic was minocycline. wolbachia contributed to the formation of mtt formazan in the mtt assay of viability and is therefore not exclusively a measure of worm viability and indicates that wolbachia contributes directly to the metabolic activity of the nematode.\n",

      "Title: species differences in pharmacokinetics and drug teratogenesis.\n",
      "Abstract: interspecies differences in regard to the teratogenicity of drugs can be the result of differing pharmacokinetic processes that determine the crucial concentration-time relationships in the embryo. maternal absorption, as well as distribution, of the drugs does not usually show great species differences. the first-pass effect after oral application is often more pronounced in animals than man (e.g., valproic acid, 13-cis-retinoic acid), although in some cases the reverse was found (e.g., hydrolysis of valpromide). existing differences can be adjusted by appropriate choice of the administration route and measurements of drug levels. many variables determine the placental transfer of drugs: developmental stage, type of placenta, properties of the drug. even closely related drugs (e.g., retinoids) may differ greatly in regard to placental transfer. maternal protein binding is an important determinant of placental transfer, since only the free concentration in maternal plasma can equilibrate with the embryo during organogenesis; this parameter differs greatly across species (e.g., valproic acid: five times higher free fractions in mouse and hamster than in monkey and man). the metabolic pattern has not yet been demonstrated to be a major cause of species differences, although recent evidence on phenytoin and thalidomide support the hypothesis that some species differences can be the result of differing activation/deactivation pathways. laboratory animals usually have a much higher rate of drug elimination than man. drastic drug level fluctuations are therefore present during teratogenicity testing in animals, but not to the same degree in human therapy. it must, therefore, be investigated if peak concentrations (such as for valproic acid and possibly caffeine) or the area under the concentration-time curve (auc) (such as for cyclophosphamide and possibly retinoids) correlate with the teratogenic response. only then is a rational and scientific basis for interspecies comparison possible. it is concluded that the prediction of the human response based on animal studies can be improved by consideration of the appropriate pharmacokinetic determinants.\n",

      "Abstract: background\n",
      "in vitro maturation (ivm) of oocytes followed by fertilization in vitro (ivf) and embryo transfer offers an alternative to conventional ivf treatment that minimises drug administration and avoids ovarian hyperstimulation. however, the technique is less efficient than maturation in vivo. in the present study, a non-human primate model was used to address the hypothesis that the number of oocytes is increased and their nuclear and cytoplasmic maturity after ivm are improved when maturation is initiated in vivo by priming with hcg.\n",
      "methods\n",
      "young, adult cynomolgus monkeys were given recombinant human (rh) gonadotropins to stimulate the development of multiple follicles, and oocytes were aspirated 0, 12, 24, or 36 h after injection of an ovulatory dose of rhcg. the nuclear status of oocytes was determined at the time of recovery and after culture for a total elapsed time of 40–44 hours after hcg.\n",
      "results\n",
      "priming with hcg significantly increased the number of oocytes harvested, especially after delaying aspiration for 24 h or longer. nuclear maturation after the full period in culture was also enhanced by priming: 71.5, 83.6, and 94.6% of oocytes collected at 0, 12, and 24 h hcg had progressed to mii by the end of the culture period, compared to 87.8% of oocytes that were retrieved at 36 h. a large proportion of oocytes reaching the mii stage had either or both abnormal spindles (>40%) and misaligned chromosomes (>60%), judging by immunofluorescence microscopy, but these abnormalities were independent of culture time. the mitochondria were evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm at all stages of maturation. importantly, there was no microscopic evidence that the duration of culture had any injurious effects on the cells.\n",

      "Abstract: background\n",
      "thyroid receptors, trα and trβ, are involved in important physiological functions such as metabolism, cholesterol level and heart activities. whereas metabolism increase and cholesterol level lowering could be achieved by trβ isoform activation, trα activation affects heart rates. therefore, β-selective thyromimetics have been developed as promising drug-candidates for treatment of obesity and elevated cholesterol level. gc-1 [3,5-dimethyl-4-(4'-hydroxy-3'-isopropylbenzyl)-phenoxy acetic acid] has ability to lower ldl cholesterol with 600- to 1400-fold more potency and approximately two- to threefold more efficacy than atorvastatin (lipitor©) in studies in rats, mice and monkeys.\n",
      "results\n",
      "to investigate gc-1 specificity, we solved crystal structures and performed molecular dynamics simulations of both isoforms complexed with gc-1. crystal structures reveal that, in trα arg228 is observed in multiple conformations, an effect triggered by the differences in the interactions between gc-1 and ser277 or the corresponding asparagine (asn331) of trβ. the corresponding arg282 of trβ is observed in only one single stable conformation, interacting effectively with the ligand. molecular dynamics support this model: our simulations show that the multiple conformations can be observed for the arg228 in trα, in which the ligand interacts either strongly with the ligand or with the ser277 residue. in contrast, a single stable arg282 conformation is observed for trβ, in which it strongly interacts with both gc-1 and the asn331.\n",

      "results\n",
      "following intraperitoneal inoculation of mice, lacv replicated in various organs before reaching the cns where it replicates to high titer causing death from neurological disease. the peripheral site where lacv replicates to highest titer is the nasal turbinates, and, presumably, lacv can enter the cns via the olfactory neurons from nasal olfactory epithelium. the mouse infectious dose50 and lethal dose50 was similar for lacv administered either intranasally or intraperitoneally. lacv was highly infectious for rhesus monkeys and infected 100% of the animals at 10 pfu. however, the infection was asymptomatic, and the monkeys developed a strong neutralizing antibody response.\n",
      "conclusion\n",
      "in mice, lacv likely gains access to the cns via the blood stream or via olfactory neurons. the ability to efficiently infect mice intranasally raises the possibility that lacv might use this route to infect its natural hosts. rhesus monkeys are susceptible to lacv infection and develop strong neutralizing antibody responses after inoculation with as little as 10 pfu. mice and rhesus monkeys are useful animal models for lacv vaccine immunologic testing although the rhesus monkey model is not optimal.\n",

      "Abstract: nuclear receptor 2e1 (nr2e1) is expressed in human fetal and adult brains; however, its role in human brain–behavior development is unknown. previously, we have corrected the cortical hypoplasia and behavioral abnormalities in nr2e1−/− mice using a genomic clone spanning human nr2e1, which bolsters the hypothesis that nr2e1 may similarly play a role in human cortical and behavioral development. to test the hypothesis that humans with abnormal brain–behavior development may have null or hypomorphic nr2e1 mutations, we undertook the first candidate mutation screen of nr2e1 by sequencing its entire coding region, untranslated, splice site, proximal promoter and evolutionarily conserved non-coding regions in 56 unrelated patients with cortical disorders, namely microcephaly. we then genotyped the candidate mutations in 325 unrelated control subjects and 15 relatives. we did not detect any coding region changes in nr2e1; however, we identified seven novel candidate regulatory mutations that were absent from control subjects. we used in silico tools to predict the effects of these candidate mutations on neural transcription factor binding sites (tfbs). four candidate mutations were predicted to alter tfbs. to facilitate the present and future studies of nr2e1, we also elucidated its molecular evolution, genetic diversity, haplotype structure and linkage disequilibrium by sequencing an additional 94 unaffected humans representing africa, the americas, asia, europe, the middle east and oceania, as well as great apes and monkeys. we detected strong purifying selection, low genetic diversity, 21 novel polymorphisms and five common haplotypes at nr2e1. we conclude that protein-coding changes in nr2e1 do not contribute to cortical and behavioral abnormalities in the patients examined here, but that regulatory mutations may play a role.\n",

      "Abstract: quantitative aspects of platelet agglutination and inhibition of clot retraction by the antibody of quinidine purpura were described. the reactions appeared to depend on formation of types of antibody-quinidine-platelet complexes which could fix complement but complement was not necessary for these reactions. complement fixation was at least 10 times more sensitive than platelet agglutination or inhibition of clot retraction for measurement and detection of antibody activity. although it has been considered that antibodies of drug purpura act as platelet lysins in the presence of complement and that direct lysis of platelets accounts for development of thrombocytopenia in drug purpura, the present study suggests that attachment of antibody produces a change in platelets which is manifested in vitro only by increased susceptibility to non-specific factors which can alter the stability of platelets in the absence of antibody. the attachment of antibody to platelets in vivo may only indirectly affect platelet survival. in contrast to human platelets, dog, rabbit, and guinea pig platelets, and normal or trypsin-treated human red cells did not agglutinate, fix complement, or adsorb antibody; and intact human endothelial cells did not fix complement or adsorb antibody. rhesus monkey platelets were not agglutinated by the antibody but did adsorb antibody and fix complement although their activity in these reactions differed quantitatively from that of human platelets. cinchonine could be substituted for quinidine in agglutination and inhibition of clot retraction reactions but quinine and cinchonidine could not. attempts to cause passive anaphylaxis in guinea pigs with the antibody of quinidine purpura were not successful.\n",

      "Abstract: 1. methods have been described for the preparation and sterilization of a synthetic nutrient medium which supports normal growth during one 24 hour asexual cycle of the erythrocytic form of p. knowlesi. 2. successive subcultures with good multiplication can be carried out when whole blood or plasma is added to the medium. data are presented from two such experiments where the sixth and seventh generations, respectively, were injected into normal monkeys. in both cases, the injections produced clinical malaria and in one, an abnormally severe course was observed. 3. a high percentage (95 per cent) of o2 inhibits multiplication in in vitro cultures. a gas phase approximating alveolar air permits normal development. a lower percentage (0.37 per cent) of o2 in the gas phase supports growth at least as well. 4. certain experiments indicate that in vitro growth is better supported in normal monkey plasma than in plasma from parasitized monkeys. heating of parasitized plasma to 56°c. for 30 minutes removed the deleterious effect. 5. a nutritional need by the parasite for glucose and p-aminobenzoic acid has been shown. attempts to demonstrate the need for other individual components of the nutrient medium have not been successful though the effect of the absence of blocks of nutrient such as purines and pyrimidines, amino acids, or water-soluble vitamins can be observed. 6. further assay of the nutritional requirements of the parasite appears to be hampered by the supply of nutrient furnished by the red cells and plasma. cultivation of parasitized cells washed free of plasma and resuspended in synthetic medium containing 1 per cent serum albumin has been accomplished as one step directed toward the removal of such interfering factors.\n",

      "Abstract: 1. the infectious agent from fatal cases of st. louis and kansas city encephalitis passes seitz pads in high dilution without appreciable loss of infectivity and traverses collodion membranes with an average pore size of 66 mµ or greater. 2. it is highly infectious for mice by the intracerebral and intranasal routes, but practically innocuous by the subcutaneous and intraperitoneal routes. 3. certain strains of mice are more susceptible than others. 4. the agent administered to mice intranasally causes tremors and convulsions after a 6 to 7 day incubation period, followed by prostration and death in 8 to 10 days. lesions are demonstrable in the olfactory bulbs 3 days after infection, in the piriform lobe after 4 days, and in ammon's horn after 5 days. 5. in macacus rhesus monkeys, the agent provokes a mild, non-fatal reaction and the development of specific neutralizing bodies. on passage in monkeys, the virus becomes progressively weaker. 6. in rabbits, guinea pigs, rats, and sheep the agent is apparently without effect. 7. all available strains of the agent proved alike in effects in animals and in immunological response. 8. the available data enable one to conclude that the agent is a filtrable virus differing from those studied heretofore.\n",

      "Abstract: young rhesus monkeys (macaca mulatta) were given a diet containing casein, polished rice, whole wheat, salt mixture, sodium chloride, cod liver oil, and ascorbic acid. they developed a syndrome characterized by anemia, leukopenia, and loss of weight. ulceration of the gums and diarrhea were common, and death occurred between the 26th and 100th day. 4 monkeys were given the deficient diet supplemented with 1 mg. of riboflavin daily, and these developed the characteristic signs and died. in periods of time similar to the survival of monkeys receiving the deficient diet alone. nicotinic acid, either alone or in combination with riboflavin and thiamin chloride, failed to alter appreciably the course of the deficiency manifestations. thus, it is evident that this nutritional cytopenia is not the result of a deficiency of vitamin b, riboflavin, or nicotinic acid. the deficient diet supplemented with either 10 gm. of dried brewers' yeast or 2 gm. of liver extract (cohn fraction g) daily supported good growth, permitted normal body development, and maintained a normal blood picture over long periods. it is obvious that yeast and liver extract contain a substance essential to the nutrition of the monkey which is not identical with any of those factors of the vitamin b complex that have been chemically identified. we have proposed the term vitamin m for this factor which prevents nutritional cytopenia in the monkey.\n",

      "Abstract: it has been possible by the intratracheal or intrabronchial inoculation of type iii pneumococcus to produce in monkeys of the m. cynomolgos species an experimental pneumonia which in its clinical aspects closely resembles pneumococcus lobar pneumonia in man. the experimental disease is characterized by the development of a well localized pulmonary lesion of lobar distribution which tends to spread, the frequent occurrence of septicemia, a sustained fever, and the termination of the infection after a variable interval, in recovery or death of the animal. wide variations in the severity of the disease in different monkeys have been noted. these variations appear to be due primarily to differences in the resistance of individual animals. the height of the septicemia accompanying the experimental pneumonia has been found to be the most valuable objective index of the probable outcome of the disease. other factors which may influence the course and outcome of the disease are discussed.\n",

      "Abstract: a case of acute ascending myelitis which followed the bite of an apparently normal macacus rhesus monkey is described. the clinical course as well as the pathological changes has been studied and found to be suggestive of a virus cause for the disease. the absence of perivascular demyelinization removes the case from the realm of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and establishes it more or less definitely as a primary acute infectious myelitis. an extremely important feature of the pathological picture of this disease has been the presence of focal necrosis in the viscera (spleen, adrenals, regional lymph nodes). attempts to transmit the disease to macacus rhesus monkeys, dogs, mice, and guinea pigs, employing glycerinated organs from the human case, proved unsuccessful. by the inoculations of rabbits the presence of a strongly neurotropic, filtrable virus was demonstrated in the patient's brain, cord, and spleen. following intracutaneous injection of it as derived either from brain and cord or spleen, an experimental disease develops in rabbits which strikingly resembles the human disease in the character of the local lesion, the incubation period, development of urinary retention, and flaccid paralysis of the posterior extremities with cephalad progression, death by respiratory failure, and finally by the occurrence of focal necrosis in the spleen, adrenals, and liver. in attempting to establish the identity of this virus, (the b virus), a consideration of its biological properties excludes the viruses of poliomyelitis, rabies, vaccinia, virus iii disease of rabbits, and the other viruses which are known to produce similar intranuclear inclusion bodies, except perhaps herpes. although the relationship between the b virus and the virus of herpes must still be determined by cross-immunity tests it has been shown to possess certain properties which warrant consideration of it as a distinct entity.\n",

      "Abstract: the first known epidemic of poliomyelitis in easton, pennsylvania, occurred in 1949, and was unusual in the high proportion of paralytic to non-paralytic cases. both poliomyelitis and cosxackie, or c, viruses were isolated from more than half the patients studied during the acute stage of the disease. one month later c virus was only occasionally recovered. classification of the 28 strains of c virus which were isolated revealed that 24 belonged to one antigenic type, easton-2 (related to albany type 1 virus). patients from whom c virus was isolated showed a rise during convalescence to the easton-2 or homologous type antibody. two patients with paralytic poliomyelitis were studied for the quantitative development of antibodies to the poliomyelitis virus and to the c virus found in their stools. using the neutralization test in monkeys and in newborn mice, respectively, a simultaneous rise in antibodies to both agents was observed. the situation at present can be summarized as follows:—poliomyelitis virus or c virus may produce infection in man, with a specific antibody response. both agents may be carried, particularly in the intestines, without causing any serious illness and healthy carrier states have been observed for each. both viruses can be found in nature in flies and in sewage. however there has been no evidence to suggest that these two viruses bear a relationship to each other, even when isolated from the same patient. thus, when both viruses are found in a patient with paralysis, it is not yet possible to say with any degree of accuracy to what extent each is responsible in the over-all pattern of the disease. how frequently dual infections of this nature may occur remains for future investigations to determine. certainly all cases of poliomyelitis are not complicated by a superimposed infection with a c virus. however, this will have to be one more item to consider in epidemic poliomyelitis.\n",

      "Abstract: the preparation of antigenic materials capable of specific fixation of complement in the presence of convalescent phase sera from patients with varicella and herpes zoster is described. satisfactory antigens were obtained by the repetitive harvest and subsequent concentration of the pooled nutrient fluids from bottle cultures of human embryonic skin-muscle tissue or of monkey kidney tissue infected with varicella or herpes zoster viruses. specific fixation of complement was also demonstrated with antigens prepared from extracts of the infected cell sheets harvested from bottle cultures. in individuals with varicella, complement-fixing antibody usually appeared in the serum 4 or 5 days after the development of the exanthem and further significant increases in titer were characteristically observed during the 2nd week of illness. the complement-fixing antibody response in herpes zoster tended to follow the same pattern as in varicella, with the exception that in sera from some individuals relatively high titers were present in the acute phase specimen. complement-fixing antigens prepared from varicella strains or from a zoster strain reacted to essentially the same degree with convalescent sera from the homologous and the heterologous clinical entities. the varicella-zoster antigens did not fix complement in the presence of paired sera obtained from a limited number of individuals with primary infections due to herpes simplex virus or from individuals with generalized vaccinia infection. specific inhibition in vitro of the focal cytopathic process produced by the varicella-zoster viruses was demonstrated. this was accomplished by the incorporation of the sera under test as constituents of nutrient media of the cultures, either prior to or at the time of their inoculation with virus. the neutralization of focal cytopathogenicity thus obtained was relative in degree and never absolute; it was therefore assayed by repetitive counts of the number of focal lesions per culture in the various test groups. inhibition of varicella-zoster viral cytopathogenicity occurred in the presence of convalescent serum from either clinical entity. the results of the immunologic studies with the viruses of herpes zoster and varicella as propagated in vitro are considered as providing further evidence in support of the concept of the close relationship and probable identity of the two agents.\n",

      "Abstract: the virus inhibitory activity and selectivity of certain benzimidazole, benzotriazole, and naphthimidazole derivatives were determined with influenza b and polio type 2 viruses. among the sixty-five compounds examined, several were highly active inhibitors of influenza b virus multiplication in the chorioallantoic membrane in vitro. the following compounds, listed in order of increasing inhibitory activity, were more than 100 times as active as benzimidazole: 5-(4'-toluenesulfonamido)-benzimidazole, 5-hydroxybenzotriazole-4-carboxy-α-naphthylamide, 4,5,6-trichlorobenzotriazole, 5-(3',4'-dichlorobenzenesulfonamido)-benzimidazole, 5-(3',4'-dichlorobenzenesulfonamido) - 1 - (3'',4'' - dichlorobenzenesulfonyl)-benzimidazole, 4-(p-chlorophenylazo)-5-hydroxybenzotriazole, and 4,5,6,7-tetrachlorobenzotriazole. however, none showed high selectivity. of the sixty-five compounds studied with influenza virus, twenty-five were also examined with poliovirus type 2 in monkey kidney cells in vitro. included in this group were five of the seven most active inhibitors of influenza virus, listed above. all five were more than 100 times as active in inhibiting poliovirus multiplication as the reference compound. in addition to these, two other compounds were highly active: 2-(α-hydroxybenzyl)-benzimidazole (hbb), and 2-(α-hydroxybenzyl)-5-chlorobenzimidazole, with relative inhibitory activities of 78 and 130, respectively. these two compounds, and the much less active 5,6-dichloro derivative of hbb, were the only ones which showed no, or only slight, toxic effects on cells at concentrations sufficient to cause considerable inhibition of poliovirus multiplication. furthermore, hbb and the 5-chloro derivative were the only compounds which caused significant inhibition of the cytopathic effects of poliovirus. hbb, and its 5-chloro and 5,6-dichloro derivatives had no effect on the multiplication of influenza b virus in the chorioallantoic membrane. in addition, hbb failed to inhibit influenza b virus multiplication and cytopathic effects in monkey kidney cells. inhibition of poliovirus-induced cell damage by hbb was characterized by the following features: the curves relating reduction in virus yield or cytopathic effects to concentration of the compound followed an approximately parallel course; somewhat higher concentrations were required to inhibit virus-induced cell damage than to reduce virus yield. hbb suppressed viral cytopathic effects for a period of time which varied directly with the concentration of compound, and inversely with the size of virus inoculum. the development of virus-induced cell damage in treated cultures on prolonged incubation was not due to inactivation of hbb. the inhibitory effect of hbb on virus-induced cell damage was reversible by removal of the compound. hbb inhibited viral cytopathic effects when given during the exponential increase phase in virus multiplication. inhibition of virus-induced cell damage by hbb was demonstrated by photomicrographs. hbb did not inactivate the infectivity of poliovirus type 2.\n",

      "Abstract: in the present investigation evidence was obtained indicating that nasal instillations of suitable concentrations of sodium alum or tannic acid induce in macacus rhesus monkeys resistance to the development of poliomyelitis when the virus is introduced by the nasal route. it was found that apparently different concentrations of these chemicals are required to exert this type of protective effect in different hosts or against different viruses, for while mice are readily protected against nasal infection with equine encephalomyelitis virus by 0.5 per cent solutions of tannic acid or alum (7), monkeys require at least 3 per cent solutions to become resistant against poliomyelitis. experiments designed to elucidate the development of this refractory state in monkeys indicate that it is a result of the action of these chemicals not upon the virus but rather upon the tissues of the host (probably the olfactory mucosa); further evidence in favor of this hypothesis may be found in the observation that several days of treatment are required before resistance is induced. while one nasal instillation a day for 3 days proved effective when additional treatments were given on the days of virus administration, there was no protection against infection when the virus was given 48 and 96 hours after the last treatment. the resistance which was demonstrable when the virus was instilled intranasally on the 4th and 6th days after the beginning of treatment was also found to be present a week later when the treatments were given daily, indicating that the refractory state can be maintained in this manner. it was observed, however, that monkeys which were given nasal instillations of alum or tannic acid for 5 days or more may retain the resistance they acquired for 1 or 2 months without any additional treatment (table v); thus, of 15 refractory monkeys retested after 1 month, 11 were still resistant; seven of 15 monkeys were refractory when retested after 2 months, while only one of 11 failed to develop poliomyelitis after an interval of 3 months. these last results suggest that to maintain such a refractory state over a period of months it may be necessary to employ daily instillations only for about a week, with subsequent repetitions at intervals of several days or a week. an experiment performed to determine the effect of beginning alum treatment soon after, rather than before, the virus is administered, indicated that there is no danger from a possible early or primary effect enhancing the invasiveness of the virus. one cannot state with any certainty, however, whether or not in some of the monkeys so treated the development of poliomyelitis is inhibited or prevented. finally, it should be stressed that treatment with alum or tannic acid either completely prevented the disease in monkeys, or else was entirely without effect. it is therefore not surprising that no evidence was obtained of development of specific, active immunity in monkeys rendered refractory by chemical treatment. as far as could be ascertained, the nasal instillation of tannic acid or alum in man proved thoroughly innocuous beyond some local irritation for a short time. the desirability of testing this procedure as an aid in the prevention of poliomyelitis in man during the months of greatest incidence or during epidemics is quite apparent. in conclusion, there may be broader implications in this approach to the prevention of certain infectious diseases transmitted naturally or experimentally by way of the nose. it seems desirable to make studies with other viruses transmitted by the nasal route, including those of influenza and the common cold. the evidence obtained in the present study that the chemically induced refractory state may persist in a large number of monkeys for a month or two after treatment over a period of 5 days or more, suggests that studies on individuals who are subject to frequent attacks of common cold may perhaps be profitable.\n",

      "Abstract: since the experimental data have already been discussed at some length, it is here necessary only to review those observations which appear to be of most significance. the manifestations of the disease we have produced in monkeys have in general been similar to those described by previous workers. it has been found that members of the species m. mulatta are regularly susceptible to infection with the virus of mumps, provided they have not been in contact with animals which have recently been infected. such contact may be followed by the development of resistance to inoculation unattended by overt signs of infection. following the intraparotid injection of virus into a susceptible animal, an antigen appears in the gland which reacts specifically in the complement fixation test with sera of monkeys which have recovered from an attack of mumps. this antigen has not been demonstrated in any other organ of the infected monkey which has been examined, nor does it persist or increase in amount when introduced into the brain or the testes. attempts to propagate it in the tissues of other animal species including the developing hen's egg and tissue cultures have so far been uniformly unsuccessful. the antigen is relatively thermostabile, resisting a temperature of 65°c. for at least 20 minutes at the optimal hydrogen ion concentration. it is unimpaired by a concentration of formalin of 0.3 per cent. together with the virus it may be preserved indefinitely in the frozen state. the maximal quantity of antigen in the gland, which may be considerable, is attained on or about the 5th day following inoculation of the virus. an antibody which reacts with the antigen appears in the serum from 8 to 14 days after infection. this antibody has not been found in the serum of normal monkeys which have had no opportunity for contact with the virus. it has been demonstrated during convalescence in the serum of all animals which have been examined. the antibody which is present in large amounts soon after recovery, although decreasing in concentration with the lapse of time, may continue to be present for many months. at 62°c. for 20 minutes its activity is not reduced and on storage at 4°c. its titer has remained unaltered for over 2 years. a similar factor which appears in human beings convalescent from mumps is less stabile, since its activity is reduced appreciably under these conditions. in the co2 cabinet, however, both antibodies can be preserved for long periods of time. the definition of these reagents has afforded means whereby the simian infection with the virus of mumps, whether it is actively in progress or has occurred at some time in the past, can be recognized. upon the establishment of these facts, the estimation of the quantity of antigen in the glands of vaccinated animals was employed as an index of their resistance in studies on the effect of the injection of formolized and alumprecipitated formolized suspensions of infected parotid gland. it has been shown that such vaccines, in which the virus has been rendered inactive, lead to the production of complement-fixing antibody. in about 60 per cent of the vaccinated animals, moreover, evidence of increased resistance was obtained as indicated by the partial or complete suppression of the formation of antigen in the inoculated gland. in certain instances no evidence of resistance was observed, yet antibody was found to be present. it is clear, therefore, that resistance is not determined solely by the presence of the complement-fixing antibody. the possibility, however, of its participation as a factor in immunity cannot be excluded. employing the same criterion of resistance, the virus-neutralizing capacity of a pool of human mumps convalescent sera and of a globulin concentrate prepared from the pool has been studied. neither of these materials was found to prevent entirely the formation of antigen, although each of them appeared to exert some inhibitory effect.\n",

      "Abstract: background\n",
      "how are morphological evolution and developmental changes related? this rather old and intriguing question had a substantial boost after the 70s within the framework of heterochrony (changes in rates or timing of development) and nowadays has the potential to make another major leap forward through the combination of approaches: molecular biology, developmental experimentation, comparative systematic studies, geometric morphometrics and quantitative genetics. here i take an integrated approach combining life-history comparative analyses, classical and geometric morphometrics applied to ontogenetic series to understand changes in size and shape which happen during the evolution of two new world monkeys (nwm) sister genera.\n",
      "results\n",
      "cebus and saimiri share the same basic allometric patterns in skull traits, a result robust to sexual and ontogenetic variation. if adults of both genera are compared in the same scale (discounting size differences) most differences are small and not statistically significant. these results are consistent using both approaches, classical and geometric morphometrics. cebus is a genus characterized by a number of peramorphic traits (adult-like) while saimiri is a genus with paedomorphic (child like) traits. yet, the whole clade cebinae is characterized by a unique combination of very high pre-natal growth rates and relatively slow post-natal growth rates when compared to the rest of the nwm. morphologically cebinae can be considered paedomorphic in relation to the other nwm. geometric morphometrics allows the precise separation of absolute size, shape variation associated with size (allometry), and shape variation non-associated with size. interestingly, and despite the fact that they were extracted as independent factors (principal components), evolutionary allometry (those differences in allometric shape associated with intergeneric differences) and ontogenetic allometry (differences in allometric shape associated with ontogenetic variation within genus) are correlated within these two genera. furthermore, morphological differences produced along these two axes are quite similar. cebus and saimiri are aligned along the same evolutionary allometry and have parallel ontogenetic allometry trajectories.\n",
      "conclusion\n",
      "the evolution of these two platyrrhini monkeys is basically due to a size differentiation (and consequently to shape changes associated with size). many life-history changes are correlated or may be the causal agents in such evolution, such as delayed on-set of reproduction in cebus and larger neonates in saimiri.\n",

      "Abstract: background\n",
      "the rectum is particularly vulnerable to hiv transmission having only a single protective layer of columnar epithelium overlying tissue rich in activated lymphoid cells; thus, unprotected anal intercourse in both women and men carries a higher risk of infection than other sexual routes. in the absence of effective prophylactic vaccines, increasing attention is being given to the use of microbicides and preventative antiretroviral (arv) drugs. to prevent mucosal transmission of hiv, a microbicide/arv should ideally act locally at and near the virus portal of entry. as part of an integrated rectal microbicide development programme, we have evaluated rectal application of the nucleotide reverse transcriptase (rt) inhibitor tenofovir (pmpa, 9-[(r)-2-(phosphonomethoxy) propyl] adenine monohydrate), a drug licensed for therapeutic use, for protective efficacy against rectal challenge with simian immunodeficiency virus (siv) in a well-established and standardised macaque model.\n",
      "methods and findings\n",
      "a total of 20 purpose-bred indian rhesus macaques were used to evaluate the protective efficacy of topical tenofovir. nine animals received 1% tenofovir gel per rectum up to 2 h prior to virus challenge, four macaques received placebo gel, and four macaques remained untreated. in addition, three macaques were given tenofovir gel 2 h after virus challenge. following intrarectal instillation of 20 median rectal infectious doses (mid50) of a noncloned, virulent stock of sivmac251/32h, all animals were analysed for virus infection, by virus isolation from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc), quantitative proviral dna load in pbmc, plasma viral rna (vrna) load by sensitive quantitative competitive (qc) rt-pcr, and presence of siv-specific serum antibodies by elisa. we report here a significant protective effect (p = 0.003; fisher exact probability test) wherein eight of nine macaques given tenofovir per rectum up to 2 h prior to virus challenge were protected from infection (n = 6) or had modified virus outcomes (n = 2), while all untreated macaques and three of four macaques given placebo gel were infected, as were two of three animals receiving tenofovir gel after challenge. moreover, analysis of lymphoid tissues post mortem failed to reveal sequestration of siv in the protected animals. we found a strong positive association between the concentration of tenofovir in the plasma 15 min after rectal application of gel and the degree of protection in the six animals challenged with virus at this time point. moreover, colorectal explants from non-siv challenged tenofovir-treated macaques were resistant to infection ex vivo, whereas no inhibition was seen in explants from the small intestine. tissue-specific inhibition of infection was associated with the intracellular detection of tenofovir. intriguingly, in the absence of seroconversion, gag-specific gamma interferon (ifn-γ)-secreting t cells were detected in the blood of four of seven protected animals tested, with frequencies ranging from 144 spot forming cells (sfc)/106 pbmc to 261 spot forming cells (sfc)/106 pbmc.\n",
      "conclusions\n",
      "these results indicate that colorectal pretreatment with arv drugs, such as tenofovir, has potential as a clinically relevant strategy for the prevention of hiv transmission. we conclude that plasma tenofovir concentration measured 15 min after rectal administration may serve as a surrogate indicator of protective efficacy. this may prove to be useful in the design of clinical studies. furthermore, in vitro intestinal explants served as a model for drug distribution in vivo and susceptibility to virus infection. the finding of t cell priming following exposure to virus in the absence of overt infection is provocative. further studies would reveal if a combined modality microbicide and vaccination strategy is feasible by determining the full extent of local immune responses induced and their protective potential.\n",
      "background.\n",
      "about 33 million people are now infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv), which causes aids by killing immune system cells. as yet, there is no cure for aids, although hiv infections can be held in check with antiretroviral drugs. also, despite years of research, there is no vaccine available that effectively protects people against hiv infection. so, to halt the aids epidemic, other ways of preventing the spread of hiv are being sought. for example, pre-exposure treatment (prophylaxis) with antiretroviral drugs is being investigated as a way to prevent hiv transmission. in addition, because hiv is often spread through heterosexual penile-to-vaginal sex with an infected partner, several vaginal microbicides (compounds that protect against hiv when applied inside the vagina) are being developed, some of which contain antiretroviral drugs.\n",
      "why was this study done?\n",
      "because hiv can cross the membranes that line the mouth and the rectum (the lower end of the large intestine that connects to the anus) in addition to the membrane that lines the vagina, hiv transmission can also occur during oral and anal sex. the lining of the rectum in particular is extremely thin and overlies tissues rich in activated t cells (the immune system cells that hiv targets), so unprotected anal intercourse carries a high risk of hiv infection. anal intercourse is common among men who have sex with men but is also more common in heterosexual populations than is generally thought. tenofovir (an antiretroviral drug that counteracts hiv after it has entered human cells) given by mouth partly protects macaques against rectal infection with simian immunodeficiency virus (siv; a virus that induces aids in monkeys and apes) so the researchers wanted to know whether this drug might be effective against rectal siv infection if applied at the site where the virus enters the body.\n",
      "what did the researchers do and find?\n",
      "to answer this question, the researchers rectally infected several macaques with siv up to 2 h after rectal application of a gel containing tenofovir, after rectal application of a gel not containing the drug, or after no treatment. in addition, a few animals were treated with the tenofovir gel after the viral challenge. most of the animals given the tenofovir gel before the viral challenge were partly or totally protected from siv infection, whereas all the untreated animals and most of those treated with the placebo gel or with the drug-containing gel after the viral challenge became infected with siv. high blood levels of tenofovir 15 min after its rectal application correlated with protection from viral infection. the researchers also collected rectal and small intestine samples from tenofovir-treated macaques that had not been exposed to siv and asked which samples were resistant to siv infection in laboratory dishes. they found that only the rectal samples were resistant to infection and only rectal cells contained tenofovir. finally, activated t cells that recognized an siv protein were present in the blood of some of the animals that were protected from siv infection by the tenofovir gel.\n",
      "what do these findings mean?\n",
      "these findings, although based on experiments in only a few animals, suggest that rectal treatment with antiretroviral drugs before rectal exposure to hiv might prevent rectal hiv transmission in people. however, results from animal experiments do not always reflect what happens in people. indeed, clinical trials of a potential vaginal microbicide that worked well in macaques were halted recently because women using the microbicide had higher rates of hiv infection than those using a control preparation. the finding that immune-system activation can occur in the absence of overt infection in animals treated with the tenofovir gel additionally suggests that a combination of a local antiretroviral/microbicide and vaccination might be a particularly effective way to prevent hiv transmission. however, because hiv targets activated t cells, viral rechallenge experiments must be done to check that the activated t cells induced by the virus in the presence of tenofovir do not increase the likelihood of infection upon re-exposure to hiv before this potential microbicide is tried in people.\n",

      "methods\n",
      "monocular vision deprivation was generated by either opaque dark contact lens or tarsorrhaphy of newborn rhesus monkeys. lgn was harvested at two or four months following induction of vision deprivation. laser capture microdissection was used to obtain individual lgn layers for total rna isolation. linear t7-based in vitro rna amplification was used to obtain sufficient rna to conduct dna microarray studies. the resulting affymetrix genechip expression data were analyzed using affymetrix genechip operating software. real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization were used to further analyze expression of selected genes.\n",
      "results\n",
      "using 52,699 microarray probe sets from a rhesus array, we identified 116 transcripts differentially expressed between deprived and nondeprived parvocellular layers: 45 genes were downregulated and 71 genes were upregulated in deprived parvocellular layers. we also observed substantial changes in deprived magnocellular laminae: 74 transcripts exhibited altered expression, 42 genes were downregulated, and 32 genes were upregulated. the genes identified in this study are involved in many diverse processes, including binding (calcium ion binding, nucleic acid binding, and nucleotide binding), catalytic activity, and signal transducer activity.\n",

      "there were significant differences in gene expression profiles between deprived and nondeprived parvocellular layers and magnocellular laminae of lgn. these alterations in gene expression may play a critical role in the molecular pathogenesis of amblyopia. the genes identified in this study may provide potential targets for therapeutic intervention of this disease.\n",

      "poxvirus-vectored vaccines against infectious diseases and cancer are currently under development. we hypothesized that the extensive use of poxvirus-vectored vaccine in future might result in co-infection and recombination between the vaccine virus and naturally occurring poxviruses, resulting in hybrid viruses with unpredictable characteristics. previously, we confirmed that co-infecting in vitro a modified vaccinia virus ankara (mva) strain engineered to express influenza virus haemagglutinin (ha) and nucleoprotein (np) genes with a naturally occurring cowpox virus (cpxv-noh1) resulted in recombinant progeny viruses (h hansen, mi okeke, ø nilssen, t traavik, vaccine 23: 499–506, 2004). in this study we analyzed the biological properties of parental and progeny hybrid viruses.\n",
      "results\n",
      "five cpxv/mva progeny viruses were isolated based on plaque phenotype and the expression of influenza virus ha protein. progeny hybrid viruses displayed in vitro cell line tropism of cpxv-noh1, but not that of mva. the ha transgene or its expression was lost on serial passage of transgenic viruses and the speed at which ha expression was lost varied with cell lines. the ha transgene in the progeny viruses or its expression was stable in african green monkey derived vero cells but became unstable in rat derived iec-6 cells. hybrid viruses lacking the ha transgene have higher levels of virus multiplication in mammalian cell lines and produced more enveloped virions than the transgene positive progenitor virus strain. analysis of the subcellular localization of the transgenic ha protein showed that neither virus strain nor cell line have effect on the subcellular targets of the ha protein. the influenza virus ha protein was targeted to enveloped virions, plasma membrane, golgi apparatus and cytoplasmic vesicles.\n",
      "conclusion\n",
      "our results suggest that homologous recombination between poxvirus-vectored vaccine and naturally circulating poxviruses, genetic instability of the transgene, accumulation of non-transgene expressing vectors or hybrid virus progenies, as well as cell line/type specific selection against the transgene are potential complications that may result if poxvirus vectored vaccines are extensively used in animals and man.\n",

      "Abstract: we used mandrills (mandrillus sphinx) naturally infected with simian t-cell leukemia virus type 1 (stlv-1) as a model for evaluating the influence of natural stlv-1 infection on the dynamics and evolution of the immune system during chronic infection. furthermore, in order to evaluate the role of the immune system in controlling the infection during latency, we induced immunosuppression in the infected monkeys. we first showed that the stlv-1 proviral load was higher in males than in females and increased significantly with the duration of infection: mandrills infected for 10–6 years had a significantly higher proviral load than those infected for 2–4 years. curiously, this observation was associated with a clear reduction in cd4+ t-cell number with age. we also found that the percentage of cd4+ t cells co-expressing the activation marker hla-dr and the mean percentage of cd25+ in cd4+ and cd8+ t cells were significantly higher in infected than in uninfected animals. furthermore, the stlv-1 proviral load correlated positively with t-cell activation but not with the frequency of t cells secreting interferon γ in response to tax peptides. lastly, we showed that, during immunosuppression in infected monkeys, the percentages of cd8+ t cells expressing hla-dr+ and of cd4+ t cells expressing the proliferation marker ki67 decreased significantly, although the percentage of cd8+ t cells expressing hla-dr+ and ki67 increased significantly by the end of treatment. interestingly, the proviral load increased significantly after immunosuppression in the monkey with the highest load. our study demonstrates that mandrills naturally infected with stlv-1 could be a suitable model for studying the relations between host and virus. further studies are needed to determine whether the different compartments of the immune response during infection induce the long latency by controlling viral replication over time. such studies would provide important information for the development of immune-based therapeutic strategies.\n",

      "Abstract: simian immunodeficiency virus (siv) infection leads to aids in experimentally infected macaques, whereas natural reservoir hosts exhibit limited disease and pathology. it is, however, unclear how natural hosts can sustain high viral loads, comparable to those observed in the pathogenic model, without developing severe disease. we performed transcriptional profiling on lymph node, blood, and colon samples from african green monkeys (natural host model) and asian pigtailed macaques (pathogenic model) to directly compare gene expression patterns during acute pathogenic versus non-pathogenic siv infection. the majority of gene expression changes that were unique to either model were detected in the lymph nodes at the time of peak viral load. results suggest a shift toward cellular stress pathways and th1 profiles during pathogenic infection, with strong and sustained type i and ii interferon responses. in contrast, a strong type i interferon response was initially induced during non-pathogenic infection but resolved after peak viral load. the natural host also exhibited controlled th1 profiles and better preservation of overall cell homeostasis. this study identified gene expression patterns that are specific to disease susceptibility, tissue compartmentalization, and infection duration. these patterns provide a unique view of how host responses differ depending upon lentiviral infection outcome.simian immunodeficiency virus (siv) does not cause disease in african green monkeys (a natural host for the virus), whereas experimentally infected asian macaques (a non-natural host) develop a progressive disease that is similar to that which occurs in hiv-infected humans. insight into how hiv causes disease and leads to development of aids may therefore be gained by comparing the response of natural and non-natural hosts to siv infection. to this end, we examined changes that occurred in gene expression levels over time and in multiple tissues derived from african green monkeys and asian macaques experimentally infected with siv. infection leads to host-specific gene expression patterns in lymph nodes, blood, and colon. the natural and non-natural hosts differed with respect to the timing, intensity, and duration of infection-induced gene expression changes associated with inflammation and response to stress.\n",

      "Abstract: the experiments recorded in this paper serve, in the first place, to confirm the experiments of dixon and halliburton on the stimulating effect of intravenous injections of extracts of choroid plexus in the secretion of the cerebrospinal fluid, and extend their observations to monkeys. they bring out also the variable effects of the virus of poliomyelitis, variations affected by the quality of the virus and also by the individual powers of resistance to infection possessed by individual monkeys. these factors of variation must be taken into account in performing and interpreting experiments on infection and particularly those on immunity and specific therapy in relation to poliomyelitis. in general it may be said that experimental infection by way of the blood is not easy to produce in monkeys unless some contributing factor, such as the existence of a coincident aseptic meningitis, operates at the same time. and yet experiments 1 and 2 show that when the strength of the virus is great the injection of relatively considerable quantities suffices to induce infection and paralysis, but not in all instances. the chief outcome of the experiments has been to determine the fact that when the intravenous inoculation of the virus does not in itself suffice to induce infection and paralysis, the intravenous injection of extracts of the choroid plexus, which in themselves excite the secretory functions which preside over the formation of the cerebrospinal fluid, is powerless to modify this result. this fact would seem to be of interest and importance, since it has already been shown that very slight structural changes in the meningeal-choroidal complex suffice to make possible or certain infection under these circumstances. apparently mere augmentation, from time to time, of the secretory functions of the choroid plexus, through intravenous injection of an extract of the choroid plexus and while the virus is still circulating, is insufficient to insure passage of the virus from the blood into the nervous tissues, upon which infection depends. neither does the augmentation exercise a restraining influence on the development of infection otherwise capable of taking place.\n",

      "Title: serum treatment of influenzal meningitis\n",
      "Abstract: the injection of virulent cultures of bacillus influenzæ into the subdural space of several species of lower monkeys is followed by the development of an acute inflammation of the meninges, corresponding in clinical, bacteriological, and pathological effects with influenzal cerebrospinal meningitis in human beings. experimental influenzal meningitis in the monkey is a lethal disease which terminates fatally in from thirty-six hours to four days after the inoculation. the injected influenza bacilli produce their effects through multiplication in the course of which they penetrate from the subdural space into the general blood current, from which they may be recovered during life and at autopsy, as is also true of the spontaneous form of influenzal meningitis in man. by repeated injection, over a period of many months, of living virulent cultures of bacillus influenzæ into the goat, an immune serum possessing moderate agglutinating and high opsonic power may be produced, which is capable, when injected into the subdural space, of arresting the progress of an experimental influenzal meningitis, and of bringing about recovery in monkeys thus affected. as a result of the serum injections, the influenza bacilli in the meninges are more freely englobed by phagocytes, their number is reduced, their capacity of growth diminished, and the eruption into the blood arrested. along with these effects go, hand in hand, cessation of the local inflammatory process and progressive amelioration of the symptoms of illness, to be followed usually by rapid restoration of health. in view of the highly fatal character of influenzal meningitis in human beings, the employment of an immune serum by subdural injection is recommended. undoubtedly it will be necessary to apply the serum early and by repeated injections, by means of lumbar puncture, to secure beneficial results. the early application will, in turn, be dependent upon prompt bacteriological diagnosis, which can be made, as a rule, by the immediate microscopical examination of the cerebrospinal fluid without the employment of cultural methods. when possible, the microscopical diagnosis should be confirmed by cultural tests.\n",

      "Abstract: 1. on the surface of genital or anal lesions, either syphilitic or non-syphilitic, there may be found occasionally a spirochaeta resembling treponema pallidum, but somewhat thicker than the latter. in general characteristics, this organism occupies an intermediary position between treponema pallidum and spirochæta refringens. 2. the treponema was obtained in pure culture from two cases. for the organism the name of treponema calligyrum is proposed. 3. treponema calligyrum is non-pathogenic for monkeys and rabbits. 4. treponema calligyrum can be distinguished from treponema pallidum, treponema microdentium, treponema macrodentium, treponema mucosum, and spirochæta refringens either by the morphology, cultural and biological properties, or all these conditions in combination. 5. under certain cultural conditions treponema calligyrum becomes thinner and may cause some difficulty of differentiation from a strain of the thick type of treponema pallidum, especially when the latter is grown under conditions which tend to render it thicker. there is no such difficulty when the average and thin types of treponema pallidum are concerned. on the other hand, by providing the calligyrum with conditions which lead to the appearance of thicker specimens and by supplying spirochæta refringens with conditions of growth that favor the development of individuals that are thinner and more regularly curved, the refringens may be made to resemble the calligyrum in general appearance; but under identical cultural conditions they can be readily distinguished.\n",

      "Abstract: bartonella bacilliformis failed to induce lesions when merely rubbed on the surface of the intact skin of a chimpanzee, an ourang-utan, and numerous macacus rhesus monkeys, although when applied to the scarified skin of the same animals it gave rise to extensive lesions. application of infectious material to the scarified skin did not always induce verruga lesions, but intradermal inoculation almost invariably gave rise to nodule formation. the localization of bartonella bacilliformis in the skin is not, in experimental animals, determined by mechanical factors, since scarification of the skin or intradermal injection of foreign substances in monkeys infected with bartonella bacilliformis does not give rise to verruga formation. the degree of susceptibility of the skin tissues appears to be considerably diminished during the course of experimental infection with bartonella bacilliformis. inoculation of the scarified skin of infected animals gave uniformly negative results, and intradermal inoculation induced only a mild local reaction. in a few exceptional instances, however, of animals previously infected with the strain of bartonella bacilliformis derived from a human verruga nodule, reinoculation with the same strain gave rise to unusually marked reactions. the evolution of the skin lesion induced in experimental animals by bartonella bacilliformis may be divided into four stages, the period of incubation, the initial stage, the mature and vascular stage, and the regression. in the initial stage the lesion is a pure angioendothelioma, but in the stage of full development the histological picture is complicated by connective tissue proliferation and occasionally also by penetration of epidermis into the lesion. the demonstration of bartonella bacilliformis in the endothelial cells distinguishes the lesion from others which simulate it. the cutaneous lesions known as verruga nodular, verruga mular, and verruga miliar have been reproduced in monkeys.\n",

      "Abstract: pfs25 is a sexual stage antigen of plasmodium falciparum that is expressed on the surface of zygote and ookinete forms of the parasite. monoclonal antibodies directed against native pfs25 can block completely the development of p. falciparum oocysts in the midgut of the mosquito vector. thus, this 25-kd protein is a potential vaccine candidate for eliciting transmission-blocking immunity in inhabitants of malaria endemic regions. we have synthesized, by secretion from yeast, a polypeptide analogue of pfs25 that reacts with conformation- dependent monoclonal antibodies, and elicits transmission-blocking antibodies when used to immunize mice and monkeys in conjunction with a muramyl tripeptide adjuvant. our results suggest the further evaluation of recombinant dna-derived pfs25 in transmission-blocking vaccination studies in humans.\n",

      "Abstract: rabbit leucocytes, injected into the basal meninges of dogs, in doses from 0.7 to one cubic centimeter apparently invariably cause death. horse leucocytes, injected in the same amounts, cause death in about 25 per cent. of the dogs. . the injection of foreign leucocytes into the meninges of monkeys causes few if any symptoms. the injection of from one to three cubic centimeters of horse leucocytes into the meningeal cavities of dogs, simultaneously with the inoculation of the meninges with tubercle bacilli, causes a slight delay in the development of the paralytic symptoms in about half the treated animals. this delay, however, is very slight when compared with the remarkable prolongation of the latent period previously observed after treatment with dog leucocytes. the injection of foreign leucocytes into the meningeal cavities of monkeys has thus far given almost uniformly negative results. in one small group of monkeys, however, inoculated by the method of lumbar puncture, the injection of rabbit leucocytes has been associated with a prolongation of the latent period in one of the treated monkeys, and with a complete prevention of the subsequent tuberculosis in a second monkey.\n",

      "Abstract: twelve normal monkeys inoculated on the mucous membranes of the nose or nose and mouth with a strain of bacillus influenzæ; originally isolated in pure culture from the pleural exudate of a case of empyema following influenzal pneumonia in man and subsequently raised in virulence by animal passage, developed an acute self-limited respiratory disease of from 3 to 5 days duration, characterized by sudden onset with profound prostration, the development of rhinitis and tracheobronchitis, with sneezing, cough, and the outpouring of a scanty mucoid, or mucopurulent exudate, a variable febrile reaction, and either a leucopenia or no significant change in the leucocyte count. this disease was complicated in five instances by purulent sinusitis of one or both antra, in three by bronchopneumonia. bacillus influenzæ was recovered at autopsy from the lesions of the disease either in pure culture or in association with organisms that are normal inhabitants of the upper respiratory tract of monkeys. of ten normal monkeys injected intratracheally with the same strain of bacillus influenzæ, seven developed bronchopneumonia, two developed tracheobronchitis without pneumonia, and one resisted infection. the general symptoms and duration of the disease were similar to those of the preceding group. there were a severe cough and accelerated respirations. bacillus influenzæ was recovered in pure culture from the lungs, bronchi, or trachea in the animals killed during the active stage of the disease. it disappeared promptly from the respiratory tract with recovery. the significance of the first series of experiments in which monkeys were inoculated in the upper respiratory tract is twofold. first, they establish the fact that bacillus influenzæ can initiate in monkeys an acute infection of the normal mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract; that is, it can act as a primary incitant of respiratory infection without the assistance of a preceding or concomitant contributing cause. in this respect it differs radically from the pneumococcus and streptococcus hæmolyticus, since experiments previously reported2, 4 have shown that neither of these organisms possesses the property of initiating an infection of the normal mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract of monkeys, even though the strains used were incalculably more virulent for monkeys than the strain of bacillus influenzæ used in the foregoing experiments. secondly, the experiments show that bacillus influenzæ infection of the mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract may spread by continuity to the paranasal sinuses, setting up an acute sinusitis, that it spreads readily to the lower respiratory tract, producing a tracheobronchitis and permitting the ready invasion of secondary bacteria, and that it may penetrate as far as the terminal bronchioles, alveolar ducts, atria, and alveoli, there setting up a bronchiolitis and true bronchopneumonia. in these respects it likewise differs radically from the pneumococcus and streptococcus hæmolyticus which do not possess these pathogenic properties as previous experiments have shown.2, 4 the bearing of these facts on the possible etiologic relation of bacillus influenzæ to influenza is important, since they show that bacillus influenzæ possesses certain definite primary pathogenic properties which distinguish it and therefore separate it from the group of recognized secondary organisms in influenzal complications, of which the pneumococcus and the streptococcus are the most frequent. the possible etiologic relation of bacillus influenzæ to influenza is further supported by the character of the respiratory disease that occurred in the monkeys. the sudden onset with profound prostration, the absence of leucocytosis or often a leucopenia, the congestion of the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract, the development on the 2nd or 3rd day of an irritative cough due to an inflammatory tracheitis or tracheobronchitis, the brief self-limited course of the infection, and the irregular febrile reactions are all characteristic of influenza. many of these symptoms were in striking contrast with the symptoms and course of pneumococcus or streptococcus infections in monkeys in which there were no prostration at onset, invariable leucocytosis, and infrequent cough developing only late in the disease. while all the above features of the disease produced in monkeys are characteristic of influenza in man, none are pathognomonic and, in fact, it is doubtful whether uncomplicated influenza possesses any pathognomonic features by which it may be diagnosed certainly in the absence of an epidemic. even during epidemic times many respiratory infections arise which, though presumably influenza, it is impossible to diagnose as such with certainty. nor does pathology help in this respect, since there would appear to be no established distinctive lesions of uncomplicated influenza in man, nor for that matter of the complications of influenza, apart from the complications which have been ascribed by pfeiffer,5 maccallum,6 wolbach,7 and others to infection with bacillus influenzæ because of the association of bacillus influenzæ in pure culture with these complications. for these reasons, although the disease produced in monkeys appears to be essentially identical with influenza in man with respect to its clinical course and complications, it is impossible to determine certainly whether it is actually so. the experiments are advanced, therefore, as evidence in favor of the etiologic relation of bacillus influenzæ to influenza, though they do not permit of a definite conclusion in this respect. their bearing upon the relation of bacillus influenzæ to certain of the complications of influenza would appear to be reasonably conclusive. the recovery of bacillus influenzæ in pure culture at autopsy from the antra, from the trachea and bronchi, and from the lungs in some of the animals developing sinusitis, bronchiolitis, and a characteristic type of bronchopneumonia confirms by animal experiment the etiologic relation of bacillus influenzæ to these complications of influenza, which hitherto has rested solely upon the frequent association of the influenza bacillus with these lesions in man. the production of tracheobronchitis and the same type of bronchopneumonia by the intratracheal injection of bacillus influenzæ in the second series of experiments serves as additional confirmation of this, but has no direct bearing on the etiologic relation of bacillus influenzæ to uncomplicated influenzæ.\n",

      "Title: experimental immunity with reference to the bacillus of leprosy \n",
      "Abstract: repeated experiments have proven that few, if any, of the ordinary laboratory and domestic animals are immune against infection by bacillus lepræ. as previously reported, the goat, horse, guinea pig, and many cold-blooded animals (couret) have been found susceptible to invasion by this organism. two factors are of great importance in effecting infection. in the first place, a sufficiently large number of organisms must be employed, and, what is still more important, second and subsequent inoculations are more liable to produce leprous lesions than are primary injections. moderate doses used in the first inoculation of animals are comparatively harmless as regards their ability to induce lesions. such preliminary doses, whether they consist of living or dead organisms, produce a condition of hypersensitiveness or allergy, which renders it possible by a second injection of viable bacilli to induce the development of a reactionary lesion. lesions arising as the result of a second inoculation develop more rapidly, increase in size more quickly, and persist for a longer period than those taking place as the result of a single inoculation, even though very large doses are used. moreover, the bacilli in these lesions are more liable to lead to metastasis and to a generalized infection. we regard the results of these experiments as having considerable bearing upon the development of the disease in human cases, since we find that it is chiefly among those living in prolonged intimate contact with leprous patients that leprosy develops. the proper interpretation of these findings is difficult and becomes, apparently, more complex the longer they are studied. we are accustomed to similar phenomena of anaphylaxis or allergy with protein materials and with certain bacteria, especially the tubercle bacillus. it is not surprising that a specific allergy or altered reaction should take place in animals previously injected with leprosy bacilli, either alive or dead; why, however, lesions should develop in which the bacilli continue to grow in animals which had recovered from previous injections, or the serum of which showed bactericidal properties and contained other specific antibodies, is not so easily understood. it is unnecessary in this paper to discuss the relative value of the different theories brought forward to explain the phenomenon of anaphylaxis. it must, nevertheless, be assumed that either as the result of the splitting of certain essentially non-toxic substances in the bacillus by specific ferment-like substances in the blood, which increase after a sensitizing dose, or by the joining of some body in the serum with certain substances in the bacilli, a toxic body is produced. following the setting free or development of these injurious bodies, there results a cellular reaction, an area of local necrosis followed usually by the appearance of cells of the lymphoid and epithelioid type, and, especially if dead bacilli are used, by polymorphonuclear leucocytes. such a reaction is usual in all allergic or anaphylactic conditions; but why the reaction should pre-dispose to the more or less permanent development of parasitic powers on the part of the bacilli is not so plain. the idea has been expressed by us, as the result of observations based chiefly upon the study of the changes in the tissues of human leprosy, that the presence of bacilli within the large multinucleated cells that are characteristic of the lesion is the result of active multiplication of the bacilli in these cells rather than of phagocytosis by the cells, although it is possible that their original entrance may be the result of phagocytic action. if this be the case, it is possible that, through the cellular reaction plus the necrosis of certain of the fixed tissue cells, a pabulum of split protein products results upon which the bacilli feed, and in which they find protection from the antibodies present in the blood serum. in our attempts to induce infection in various mammalian species with cultures of human leprosy, positive results have been obtained in almost every instance after the second injection of large numbers of the organism. in this manner, we have been successful in the production of lesions in the monkey, goat, horse, guinea pig, and mouse. the results of these experiments lead us to believe that the mechanism through which invasion and multiplication follows in these lower animals is similar to if not identical with that in man. a careful study of the progress of the disease in man together with the behavior of the organism in the monkey and the goat would suggest, at least, that the function of toxin production is, after all, of little use to the leprosy bacillus because it has seemingly acquired a highly parasitic existence; instead of which it is not only possible, but highly probable, that its defensive protection, whatever it may be, is enormously developed. after the inoculation of animals with either dead or living bacilli, the production of specific antibodies is induced; these do not develop in any considerable amount and apparently show no marked tendency to increase upon repeated injections. the tests of the sera in vitro indicate that the antisubstances are produced chiefly by the first few injections. either the existence of some specific bacterial protective body, or what seems more probable, the protection afforded by the host cells in which the bacilli become ensconsed accounts, we believe, for the difficulty of producing in animals an antiserum of high potency. the idea, too, that the bacilli do not multiply to any great extent until they have entered certain cells of the host has, in a large measure, been verified by the artificial cultivation experiments. we know from our studies upon the biology of the organism that it will live for years in the most unfavorable conditions. this would suggest that during their sojourn in the tissue cells death as the result of autolysis rarely occurs, and as long as the cells can withstand the multiplication of the bacilli within and remain alive, so long are the bacilli protected from outside injurious influences, in consequence of which no disintegration of bacilli occurs to induce the production of immune bodies. on the other hand, death of the cells carrying the bacilli must occur from time to time, and this exposes large numbers of the organisms to the action of the body fluids, and, in consequence, to the condition of formation of specific antibodies.\n",

      "Abstract: from a study of strongyloides infections in man and animals in this region, it has been determined, in confirmation of the view of grassi, calmette, and others, that they are not causative factors in the production of diarrhea. the mother worm, however, burrows into the mucosa and deposits her ova there. certain tissue reactions take place and are evidenced by the cellular proliferation in those portions of the intestines occupied by the nematodes. in animals, there is an associated anemia, not positively attributable to the strongyloides, but, on the other hand, not attributable to any other cause. it is possible that s. stercoralis may cause some degree of anemia in man. the amount is indeterminable in this region among hospital cases on account of the associated hookworm disease or malaria. portals of entry for various microörganisms are made by the female mother worm and her larvæ in the small intestine, and, while no case of general bacterial infection has been proved to have arisen in this way, its occurrence is possible and highly probable. in the cultures of strongyloides of man, there is among natives, who presumably are infected with purely tropical strains, a very marked predominance of development by the indirect or sexually differentiated mode, in some cases, an absolutely pure culture of the indirect mode larvæ being obtained. there are, however, natives, cultures from whose stools contain from a single filariform larva of the direct phase up to a very definite predominance of this mode. cultures from natives of the temperate zones contain a marked predominance of the direct phase larvæ. the presence of the filariform (direct mode), larva is perhaps best accounted for by its being an attempt at more perfect parasitism (stiles). from a correlation of culture study with the results of a histological examination of the invaded mucosa, this explanation of the derivation of the two phases is suggested. the mother worm in the intestinal tract has two kinds of progeny: (a) those expelled into the crypts or lumen, and (b) those imbedded in the intestinal wall. one lot becomes larvæ of either the direct or indirect phase; the other lot of the opposite phase. it appears to me that the intraepithelial cell-developed larvæ furnish the direct phase, while the embryos expelled directly from the mother become the indirect phase larvæ. this will require for its confirmation a study of cultures in connection with a histological examination of the infected intestinal wall. cold merely inhibits the development of the larvγaelig; into either the filariform (direct) or into the sexually differentiated adults, and does not alter the anlage. the resistant as well as the infecting form is the filariform larva, and all chemical larvicides must be directed against this form. thymol and an alkaline cresol resin soap were found to be effective larvicides for the filariform larvæ. two new strongyloides of the monkey and ant bear are described. cultures of these nematodes show a predominance of the indirect mode of development.\n",

      "Abstract: 1. the subcutaneous injection of small doses of living virulent pneumococcus type i stimulates in monkeys a degree of active immunity sufficient to protect them against experimental pneumococcus pneumonia of homologous type. 2. the subcutaneous injection of living avirulent pneumococcus type i, if administered in a sufficiently large dose, likewise renders the monkey immune to a subsequent pneumonia of homologous type. 3. vaccination of monkeys with small doses of living virulent pneumococci may or may not be followed by a severe constitutional reaction, depending on the natural resistance of the individual. the severe reactions are caused by the development of a pneumococcus septicemia. which is either temporary, or leads to a fatal termination. the mild reactions are not accompanied by septicemia, and there are no symptoms other than a slight elevation of temperature and moderate leucocytosis. vaccination with living avirulent pneumococci does not induce severe reactions and is not accompanied by pneumococcus septicemia. 4. active immunity against pneumococcus pneumonia, produced by vaccination with living pneumococci, appears to be largely independent of the presence or absence of agglutinins and protective bodies in the serum of the monkey. 5. vaccination with living cultures of pneumococcus type i confers against other types of pneumococci a certain amount of cross-immunity which, however, varies considerably with the individual monkey. 6. immunity against pneumococcus, like other forms of immunity, is a relative term, and depends upon the capacity of the individual for antibody production, the virulence of the invading microorganism, and the size of the dose injected.\n",

      "Abstract: purpose\n",
      "high oxygen consumption and cyclical changes related to dark-adaptation are characteristic of the outer retina. oxygenation changes may contribute to the selective vulnerability of the retina in retinitis pigmentosa (rp) patients, especially for those forms involving genes with global cellular functions. genes coding for components of the u4/u6.u5 tri small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (tri-snrnp) complex of the spliceosome stand out, because mutations in four genes cause rp, i.e., rp9 (pap1), rp11 (prpf31), rp13 (prpf8), and rp18 (prpf3), while there is no degeneration outside the retina despite global expression of these genes. with the assumption that variable oxygenation plays a role in rp forms related to pre-mrna splicing and the retina and brain are similar, we searched a data collection of ischemia-hypoxia regulated genes of the brain for oxygen regulated genes of the u4/u6.u5 tri-snrnp complex.\n",
      "methods\n",
      "a database of ischemia-hypoxia response (ihr) genes in the brain was generated from gene expression profiling studies [n=24]. public databases (ncbi) were searched for rp genes with global function that are expressed in the brain. from the ihr gene list, we extracted genes that were directly related to retinal degeneration through a listed mutation (omim, retnet, risn). the database was then examined for indirect links to rp forms affecting the u4/u6.u5 tri-snrnp complex by searching for ihr genes contributing to this complex. potential expression of matched genes in the retina was ascertained using neibank. immunohistochemistry was used to localize a selected protein of the u4/u6.u5 tri-snrnp complex in cynomolgus monkey and human retina specimens.\n",
      "results\n",
      "the approach identified genes that cause retinal degeneration (cngb1, sema4a, rrg4) or developmental changes (sox2) when mutated. one ihr gene, pim1, is the immediate binding partner for pap1 (rp9). three ihr genes linked the u4/u6.u5 tri-snrnp complex to regulation by oxygenation: prpf4; sart1, also known as 110 kda sr-related protein of the u4/u6.u5 tri-snrnp or as hypoxia associated factor (haf); and lsm8, u6 snrna-associated sm-like protein. the 110 kda sr-related protein was localized in all retinal cells including photoreceptors.\n",
      "conclusions\n",
      "regulation by changes in oxygenation within the u4/u6.u5 tri-snrp complex could be particularly important for photoreceptors where oxygen consumption follows a circadian rhythm. if the u4/u6.u5 tri-snrp complex is already impaired by mutations in any of the four genes causing rp, it may be unable to follow properly the physiological demands of oxygenation which are mediated by the four hypoxia-regulated proteins emerging in this study. selective vulnerability may involve complex combinations of widely expressed genes, specific cellular functions and local energy availability.\n",

      "Abstract: the potential use of variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, as a bioweapon and the endemic presence of monkeypox virus in africa demonstrate the need for better therapies for orthopoxvirus infections. chemotherapeutic approaches to control viral infections have been less successful than those targeting bacterial infections. while bacteria commonly reproduce themselves outside of cells and have metabolic functions against which antibiotics can be directed, viruses replicate in the host cells using the cells' metabolic pathways. this makes it very difficult to selectively target the virus without damaging the host. therefore, the development of antiviral drugs against poxviruses has initially focused on unique properties of the viral replication cycle or of viral proteins that can be selectively targeted. however, recent advances in molecular biology have provided insights into host factors that represent novel drug targets. the latest anti-poxvirus drugs are kinase inhibitors, which were originally developed to treat cancer progression but in addition block egress of poxviruses from infected cells. this review will summarize the current understanding of anti-poxvirus drugs and will give an overview of the development of the latest second generation poxvirus drugs.\n",

      "Abstract: ebola viruses are highly lethal human pathogens that have received considerable attention in recent years due to an increasing re-emergence in central africa and a potential for use as a biological weapon. there is no vaccine or treatment licensed for human use. in the past, however, important advances have been made in developing preventive vaccines that are protective in animal models. in this regard, we showed that a single injection of a live-attenuated recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vector expressing the ebola virus glycoprotein completely protected rodents and nonhuman primates from lethal ebola challenge. in contrast, progress in developing therapeutic interventions against ebola virus infections has been much slower and there is clearly an urgent need to develop effective post-exposure strategies to respond to future outbreaks and acts of bioterrorism, as well as to treat laboratory exposures. here we tested the efficacy of the vesicular stomatitis virus-based ebola vaccine vector in post-exposure treatment in three relevant animal models. in the guinea pig and mouse models it was possible to protect 50% and 100% of the animals, respectively, following treatment as late as 24 h after lethal challenge. more important, four out of eight rhesus macaques were protected if treated 20 to 30 min following an otherwise uniformly lethal infection. currently, this approach provides the most effective post-exposure treatment strategy for ebola infections and is particularly suited for use in accidentally exposed individuals and in the control of secondary transmission during naturally occurring outbreaks or deliberate release.being highly pathogenic for humans and monkeys and the subject of former weapons programs makes ebola virus one of the most feared pathogens worldwide today. due to a lack of licensed pre- and post-exposure intervention, our current response depends on rapid diagnostics, proper isolation procedures, and supportive care of case patients. consequently, the development of more specific countermeasures is of high priority for the preparedness of many nations. in this study, we investigated an attenuated vesicular stomatitis virus expressing the ebola virus surface glycoprotein, which had previously demonstrated convincing efficacy as a vaccine against ebola infections in rodents and monkeys, for its potential use in the treatment of an ebola virus infection. surprisingly, treatment of guinea pigs and mice as late as 24 h after lethal ebola virus infection resulted in 50% and 100% survival, respectively. more important, 50% of rhesus macaques (4/8) were protected if treated 20 to 30 min after ebola virus infection. currently, this approach provides the most effective treatment strategy for ebola infections and seems particularly suited for the use in accidental exposures and the control of human-to-human transmission during outbreaks.\n",

      "Abstract: current anticholinesterase pesticides were developed during world war ii and are toxic to mammals because they target a catalytic serine residue of acetylcholinesterases (aches) in insects and in mammals. a sequence analysis of aches from 73 species and a three-dimensional model of a malaria-carrying mosquito (anopheles gambiae) ache (agache) reported here show that c286 and r339 of agache are conserved at the opening of the active site of aches in 17 invertebrate and four insect species, respectively. both residues are absent in the active site of aches of human, monkey, dog, cat, cattle, rabbit, rat, and mouse. the 17 invertebrates include house mosquito, japanese encephalitis mosquito, african malaria mosquito, german cockroach, florida lancelet, rice leaf beetle, african bollworm, beet armyworm, codling moth, diamondback moth, domestic silkworm, honey bee, oat or wheat aphid, the greenbug, melon or cotton aphid, green peach aphid, and english grain aphid. the four insects are house mosquito, japanese encephalitis mosquito, african malaria mosquito, and german cockroach. the discovery of the two invertebrate-specific residues enables the development of effective and safer pesticides that target the residues present only in mosquito aches rather than the ubiquitous serine residue, thus potentially offering an effective control of mosquito-borne malaria. anti-agache pesticides can be designed to interact with r339 and subsequently covalently bond to c286. such pesticides would be toxic to mosquitoes but not to mammals.\n",

      "Abstract: perinatal environmental tobacco smoke (ets) exposure in humans elicits neurobehavioral deficits. we exposed rhesus monkeys to ets during gestation and through 13 months postnatally, or postnatally only (6–13 months). at the conclusion of exposure, we examined cerebrocortical regions and the midbrain for cell damage markers and lipid peroxidation. for perinatal ets, two archetypal patterns were seen in the various regions, one characterized by cell loss (reduced dna concentration) and corresponding increases in cell size (increased protein/dna ratio), and a second pattern suggesting replacement of larger neuronal cells with smaller and more numerous glia (increased dna concentration, decreased protein/dna ratio). the membrane/total protein ratio, a biomarker of neurite formation, also indicated potential damage to neuronal projections, accompanied by reactive sprouting. when ets exposure was restricted to the postnatal period, the effects were similar in regional selectivity, direction, and magnitude. these patterns resemble the effects of prenatal nicotine exposure in rodent and primate models. surprisingly, perinatal ets exposure reduced the level of lipid peroxidation as assessed by the concentration of thiobarbituric acid reactive species, whereas postnatal ets did not. the heart, a tissue that, like the brain, has high oxygen demand, displayed a similar but earlier decrease (2–3 months) in lipid peroxidation in the perinatal exposure model, whereas values were reduced at 13 months with the postnatal exposure paradigm. our results provide a mechanistic connection between perinatal ets exposure and neurobehavioral anomalies, reinforce the role of nicotine in these effects, and buttress the importance of restricting or eliminating ets exposure in young children.\n",

      "Abstract: several methods of quantitative risk assessment that have been described recently are particularly applicable to neurotoxic end points. these methods can be broadly divided into two types of approaches based on their treatment of dose-response data to estimate risks. benchmark approaches estimate risks using variability in response to a fixed dose level in comparison with background control variability. probabilistic approaches estimate risks using the variability in the dose to produce a small effect in the sample population. the current report seeks to extend the development of probabilistic approaches for neurotoxic end points. because behavioral data are often used to assess therapeutic efficacy as well as toxicity (unwanted effects), this analysis focused on the relative risks of producing these effects with the same agent. the therapeutic potential of gbr 12909 was determined by its ability to decrease cocaine-maintained responding in monkeys. the effects of this agent were also assessed in the same monkeys using food-maintained responding to provide an indication of behavioral toxicity. gbr 12909 decreased both behaviors, with complete decreases on drug-seeking behavior occurring at doses that had minimal effects on food-maintained responding. the difference in the estimates of doses to decrease drug-seeking and food-maintained behavior suggested that specific therapeutic effects could be obtained in the absence of unwanted side effects for a definable proportion of the population. these results also suggest that multiple behavioral end points can be useful for identifying specific effects of chemicals for the purposes' of risk assessment.\n",

      "Abstract: background\n",
      "ebola virus causes a hemorrhagic fever syndrome that is associated with high mortality in humans. in the absence of effective therapies for ebola virus infection, the development of a vaccine becomes an important strategy to contain outbreaks. immunization with dna and/or replication-defective adenoviral vectors (rad) encoding the ebola glycoprotein (gp) and nucleoprotein (np) has been previously shown to confer specific protective immunity in nonhuman primates. gp can exert cytopathic effects on transfected cells in vitro, and multiple gp forms have been identified in nature, raising the question of which would be optimal for a human vaccine.\n",
      "methods and findings\n",
      "to address this question, we have explored the efficacy of mutant gps from multiple ebola virus strains with reduced in vitro cytopathicity and analyzed their protective effects in the primate challenge model, with or without np. deletion of the gp transmembrane domain eliminated in vitro cytopathicity but reduced its protective efficacy by at least one order of magnitude. in contrast, a point mutation was identified that abolished this cytopathicity but retained immunogenicity and conferred immune protection in the absence of np. the minimal effective rad dose was established at 1010 particles, two logs lower than that used previously.\n",
      "conclusions\n",
      "expression of specific gps alone vectored by rad are sufficient to confer protection against lethal challenge in a relevant nonhuman primate model. elimination of np from the vaccine and dose reductions to 1010 rad particles do not diminish protection and simplify the vaccine, providing the basis for selection of a human vaccine candidate.\n",
      "background.\n",
      "humans who get infected with ebola virus develop an illness called ebola hemorrhagic fever (ehv), which is one of the most deadly viral diseases known; 50%–90% of all ill patients die, and there is no available treatment for ehv. scientists think that the occasional outbreaks of the disease occur because the virus “jumps” from an infected animal to a person (a rare event) and then is transmitted between people by direct contact with infected blood or other body fluids or parts. several strains or variants of the ebola virus exist. most outbreaks have been caused either by the zaire strain or by the sudan/gulu strain (so-called because that is where the particular virus was first isolated). scientists are working on a vaccine against ebola that could be given to people before they get infected and then protect them when they come in contact with the virus. a number of candidate vaccines have been developed and tested in animals.\n",
      "why was this study done?\n",
      "the researchers who did this study are working on a vaccine that consists of two particular parts of the virus. one part is called gp (which stands for glycoprotein) and is from the outer coat of the virus; the other, np (nucleoprotein), is from its inside. without the rest of the virus, gp and np cannot cause ebv. however, the hope is that giving these parts of the virus to an individual can educate their immune system to build a response against gp and np, which would then recognize the virus should the vaccinated person become infected with the whole virus, and destroy it before it can cause disease. to get the gp and np parts into the body so that they can cause a strong immune response (which is what effective vaccines do), the researchers used a manmade version of another, harmless virus called recombinant adenovirus 5 (or rad5) to carry the np and gp. the researchers have shown previously that this strategy for introducing a vaccine works in animals. the vaccine—i.e., the combination of the rad5 virus and the two ebola virus parts—can protect animals against subsequent infection with real ebola virus that would otherwise kill them. however, during these earlier studies, the researchers had noticed that the gp part, when present at high levels, seemed to make human cells sick. they had not seen any similar problems in the experimental animals, but to be on the safe side they decided to see whether they could change the gp part so that it would still be effective as a vaccine but no longer make human cells sick.\n",
      "what did the researchers do and find?\n",
      "they changed the gp part of the vaccine in different ways so that it would no longer make human cells sick and then tested whether the resulting vaccines (combined with the original np part and the ad5 virus) could still protect monkeys from ehf after they were infected with ebola virus. they found that some of the new gp versions made the vaccine less effective, but others did what they had hoped for; namely, they gave the same level of protection as when the original gp part was present. while doing these experiments, the researchers also found that the np component seemed unnecessary and in some cases even weakened the vaccine's effect.\n",
      "what do these findings mean?\n",
      "the researchers have now developed a simplified vaccine against ebola virus that is effective in monkeys. this vaccine consists of only a modified gp component (which is well tolerated by human cells even at high concentrations) and the rad5 component. this vaccine is not the only candidate currently being developed against ebola, but it seems likely that it is one of a few that will be tested in human volunteers in the near future. the initial clinical trials will test whether the vaccine is safe in humans, and whether it can cause the immune system to produce an immune response that is specific for the ebola virus. assuming that the outcomes of these trials are positive, the next question is whether the vaccine can protect humans against ebola disease. because ebola is so dangerous and outbreaks are relatively rare, the vaccine will likely be tested only during an actual outbreak. at that time, an experimental vaccine might be given to people at immediate risk of becoming infected, especially health-care workers who, because they take care of infected patients, are themselves at very high risk of becoming infected. in addition to trials in humans, the scientists will also explore whether this vaccine, which was developed based on the gp component of the zaire strain, can protect monkeys against infections with other strains of the ebola virus.\n",

      "Abstract: enormous effort has been focused over the last decade and a half on characterizing the behavioral effects of lead in the developing organism. while age-appropriate standardized measures of intelligence (iq) have been the dependent variable most often used to assess lead-induced cognitive impairment in epidemiologic studies, researchers have also used a variety of other methods designed to assess specific behavioral processes sensitive to lead. increased reaction time and poorer performance on vigilance tasks associated with increased lead body burden suggest increased distractibility and short attention span. assessment of behavior on teachers' rating scales identified increased distractibility, impulsivity, nonpersistence, inability to follow sequences of directions, and inappropriate approach to problems as hallmarks of lead exposure. robust deficits in learned skills such as reading, spelling, math, and word recognition have also been found. spatial organizational perception and abilities seem particularly sensitive to lead-induced impairment. assessment of complex tasks of learning and memory in both rats and monkeys has revealed overall deficits in function over a variety of behavioral tasks. exploration of behavioral mechanisms responsible for these deficits identified increased distractibility perseveration, inability to inhibit inappropriate responding, and inability to change response strategy as underlying deficits. thus, there is remarkable congruence between the epidemiologic and experimental literatures with regard to the behavioral processes identified as underlying the deficits inflicted by developmental lead exposure. however, careful behavioral analysis was required from researchers in both fields for such understanding to emerge.\n",

      "Abstract: variation in genes underlying host immunity can lead to marked differences in susceptibility to hiv infection among humans. despite heavy reliance on non-human primates as models for hiv/aids, little is known about which host factors are shared and which are unique to a given primate lineage. here, we investigate whether copy number variation (cnv) at ccl3-like genes (ccl3l), a key genetic host factor for hiv/aids susceptibility and cell-mediated immune response in humans, is also a determinant of time until onset of simian-aids in rhesus macaques. using a retrospective study of 57 rhesus macaques experimentally infected with sivmac, we find that ccl3l cnv explains approximately 18% of the variance in time to simian-aids (p<0.001) with lower ccl3l copy number associating with more rapid disease course. we also find that ccl3l copy number varies significantly (p<10−6) among rhesus subpopulations, with indian-origin macaques having, on average, half as many ccl3l gene copies as chinese-origin macaques. lastly, we confirm that ccl3l shows variable copy number in humans and chimpanzees and report on ccl3l cnv within and among three additional primate species. on the basis of our findings we suggest that (1) the difference in population level copy number may explain previously reported observations of longer post-infection survivorship of chinese-origin rhesus macaques, (2) stratification by ccl3l copy number in rhesus siv vaccine trials will increase power and reduce noise due to non-vaccine-related differences in survival, and (3) ccl3l cnv is an ancestral component of the primate immune response and, therefore, copy number variation has not been driven by hiv or siv per se.development of vaccines for hiv/aids is a pressing global issue. the rhesus monkey remains the primary model for testing potential human vaccines; however, little is known about similarities and differences in host genes involved in hiv/aids response in humans and rhesus monkeys. understanding these similarities and/or differences should allow more efficient testing of vaccines beneficial to humans. here we describe the role that variation in the number of copies of ccl3-like genes (ccl3l) plays in siv progression rates in rhesus monkeys. copy number variation (cnv) of these genes has previously been shown to play a role in susceptibility and progression of hiv in humans. our results suggest that individual monkeys with lower ccl3l copy number progress more rapidly. accounting for ccl3l cnv in rhesus vaccine trials will improve researchers' abilities to interpret survival data.\n",

      "Abstract: background\n",
      "understanding the evolutionary origins of a phenotype requires understanding the relationship between ontogenetic and phylogenetic processes. human infants have been shown to undergo a process of perceptual narrowing during their first year of life, whereby their intersensory ability to match the faces and voices of another species declines as they get older. we investigated the evolutionary origins of this behavioral phenotype by examining whether or not this developmental process occurs in non-human primates as well.\n",
      "methodology/principal findings\n",
      "we tested the ability of infant vervet monkeys (cercopithecus aethiops), ranging in age from 23 to 65 weeks, to match the faces and voices of another non-human primate species (the rhesus monkey, macaca mulatta). even though the vervets had no prior exposure to rhesus monkey faces and vocalizations, our findings show that infant vervets can, in fact, recognize the correspondence between rhesus monkey faces and voices (but indicate that they do so by looking at the non-matching face for a greater proportion of overall looking time), and can do so well beyond the age of perceptual narrowing in human infants. our results further suggest that the pattern of matching by vervet monkeys is influenced by the emotional saliency of the face+voice combination. that is, although they looked at the non-matching screen for face+voice combinations, they switched to looking at the matching screen when the voice was replaced with a complex tone of equal duration. furthermore, an analysis of pupillary responses revealed that their pupils showed greater dilation when looking at the matching natural face/voice combination versus the face/tone combination.\n",
      "conclusions/significance\n",
      "because the infant vervets in the current study exhibited cross-species intersensory matching far later in development than do human infants, our findings suggest either that intersensory perceptual narrowing does not occur in old world monkeys or that it occurs later in development. we argue that these findings reflect the faster rate of neural development in monkeys relative to humans and the resulting differential interaction of this factor with the effects of early experience.\n",

      "the web has seen an explosion of chemistry and biology related resources in the last 15 years: thousands of scientific journals, databases, wikis, blogs and resources are available with a wide variety of types of information. there is a huge need to aggregate and organise this information. however, the sheer number of resources makes it unrealistic to link them all in a centralised manner. instead, search engines to find information in those resources flourish, and formal languages like resource description framework and web ontology language are increasingly used to allow linking of resources. a recent development is the use of userscripts to change the appearance of web pages, by on-the-fly modification of the web content. this opens possibilities to aggregate information and computational results from different web resources into the web page of one of those resources.\n",
      "results\n",
      "several userscripts are presented that enrich biology and chemistry related web resources by incorporating or linking to other computational or data sources on the web. the scripts make use of greasemonkey-like plugins for web browsers and are written in javascript. information from third-party resources are extracted using open application programming interfaces, while common universal resource locator schemes are used to make deep links to related information in that external resource. the userscripts presented here use a variety of techniques and resources, and show the potential of such scripts.\n",
      "conclusion\n",
      "this paper discusses a number of userscripts that aggregate information from two or more web resources. examples are shown that enrich web pages with information from other resources, and show how information from web pages can be used to link to, search, and process information in other resources. due to the nature of userscripts, scientists are able to select those scripts they find useful on a daily basis, as the scripts run directly in their own web browser rather than on the web server. this flexibility allows the scientists to tune the features of web resources to optimise their productivity.\n",

      "Title: the occurrence of intercellular bridges in groups of cells exhibiting synchronous differentiation\n",
      "Abstract: a previous electron microscopic study of the cat testis revealed that spermatids derived from the same spermatogonium are joined together by intercellular bridges. the present paper records the observation of similar connections between spermatocytes and between spermatids in hydra, fruit-fly, opossum, pigeon, rat, hamster, guinea pig, rabbit, monkey, and man. in view of these findings, it is considered likely that a syncytial relationship within groups of developing male germ cells is of general occurrence and is probably responsible for their synchronous differentiation. when clusters of spermatids, freshly isolated from the germinal epithelium are observed by phase contrast microscopy, the constrictions between the cellular units of the syncytium disappear and the whole group coalesces into a spherical multinucleate mass. the significance of this observation in relation to the occurrence of abnormal spermatozoa in semen and the prevalence of multinucleate giant cells in pathological testes is discussed. in the ectoderm of hydra, the clusters of cnidoblasts that arise from proliferation of interstitial cells are also connected by intercellular bridges. the development of nematocysts within these groups of conjoined cells is precisely synchronized. both in the testis of vertebrates and the ectoderm of hydra, a syncytium results from incomplete cytokinesis in the proliferation of relatively undifferentiated cells. the intercellular bridges between daughter cells are formed when the cleavage furrow encounters the spindle remnant and is arrested by it. the subsequent dissolution of the spindle filaments establishes free communication between the cells. the discovery of intercellular bridges in the two unrelated tissues discussed here suggests that a similar syncytial relationship may be found elsewhere in nature where groups of cells of common origin differentiate synchronously.\n",

      "Abstract: a technic is described for high resolution intracellular autoradiography in the electron microscope. cultures of llc-mk2 monkey kidney cells were incubated for 72 hours in a medium containing 0.4 µcurie per ml of thymidine-h3. after labeling, the cells were fixed with osmium tetroxide and embedded in methacrylate. ultrathin sections of the labeled tissue were taken up on formvar-coated and carbon-stabilized electron microscope grids. a 150 to 450 a layer of silver metal was then evaporated onto the tissue. the coated grids were exposed to bromine vapor for 1.5 to 2 minutes under red light, allowed to dry for 1 minute, and then covered with a thin film of 1 per cent aqueous gelatin applied by means of a fine wire loop lowered over the grid supported on a glass peg. for autoradiographic exposure, the grids were stored 50 days in a light-proof container at 4°c with calcium chloride desiccant. development was carried out for 5 minutes at 20°c in promicrol (may and baker, england) diluted 1:1 with water, followed by a 1 minute water wash and fixation for 2.5 minutes in 15 per cent aqueous sodium thiosulphate. after removal of the gelatin by immersion for 16 hours in water at 37°c, the autoradiograms were dried and examined in the electron microscope. ultrastructural detail was fairly well defined and the cytoplasm of each labeled cell was covered with an electron opaque deposit of silver, suggesting that a polynucleotide containing thymidine may be synthesized in the cytoplasm. the matter is discussed.\n",

      "nonhuman primates (nhps) are essential for biomedical research due to their similarities to humans. the utility of nhps will be greatly increased by the application of genomics-based approaches such as gene expression profiling. sequence information from the 3' end of genes is the key resource needed to create oligonucleotide expression arrays.\n",
      "results\n",
      "we have developed the algorithms and procedures necessary to quickly acquire sequence information from the 3' end of nonhuman primate orthologs of human genes. to accomplish this, we identified terminal exons of over 15,000 human genes by aligning mrna sequences with genomic sequence. we found the mean length of complete last exons to be approximately 1,400 bp, significantly longer than previous estimates. we designed primers to amplify genomic dna, which included at least 300 bp of the terminal exon. we cloned and sequenced the pcr products representing over 5,500 macaca mulatta (rhesus monkey) orthologs of human genes. this sequence information has been used to select probes for rhesus gene expression profiling. we have also tested 10 sets of primers with genomic dna from macaca fascicularis (cynomolgus monkey), papio hamadryas (baboon), and chlorocebus aethiops (african green monkey, vervet). the results indicate that the primers developed for this study will be useful for acquiring sequence from the 3' end of genes for other nonhuman primate species.\n",

      "Abstract: thimerosal is a preservative that has been used in manufacturing vaccines since the 1930s. reports have indicated that infants can receive ethylmercury (in the form of thimerosal) at or above the u.s. environmental protection agency guidelines for methylmercury exposure, depending on the exact vaccinations, schedule, and size of the infant. in this study we compared the systemic disposition and brain distribution of total and inorganic mercury in infant monkeys after thimerosal exposure with those exposed to mehg. monkeys were exposed to mehg (via oral gavage) or vaccines containing thimerosal (via intramuscular injection) at birth and 1, 2, and 3 weeks of age. total blood hg levels were determined 2, 4, and 7 days after each exposure. total and inorganic brain hg levels were assessed 2, 4, 7, or 28 days after the last exposure. the initial and terminal half-life of hg in blood after thimerosal exposure was 2.1 and 8.6 days, respectively, which are significantly shorter than the elimination half-life of hg after mehg exposure at 21.5 days. brain concentrations of total hg were significantly lower by approximately 3-fold for the thimerosal-exposed monkeys when compared with the mehg infants, whereas the average brain-to-blood concentration ratio was slightly higher for the thimerosal-exposed monkeys (3.5 ± 0.5 vs. 2.5 ± 0.3). a higher percentage of the total hg in the brain was in the form of inorganic hg for the thimerosal-exposed monkeys (34% vs. 7%). the results indicate that mehg is not a suitable reference for risk assessment from exposure to thimerosal-derived hg. knowledge of the toxicokinetics and developmental toxicity of thimerosal is needed to afford a meaningful assessment of the developmental effects of thimerosal-containing vaccines.\n",

      "Abstract: ebola virus (ebov) is a significant human pathogen that presents a public health concern as an emerging/re-emerging virus and as a potential biological weapon. substantial progress has been made over the last decade in developing candidate preventive vaccines that can protect nonhuman primates against ebov. among these prospects, a vaccine based on recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (vsv) is particularly robust, as it can also confer protection when administered as a postexposure treatment. a concern that has been raised regarding the replication-competent vsv vectors that express ebov glycoproteins is how these vectors would be tolerated by individuals with altered or compromised immune systems such as patients infected with hiv. this is especially important as all ebov outbreaks to date have occurred in areas of central and western africa with high hiv incidence rates in the population. in order to address this concern, we evaluated the safety of the recombinant vsv vector expressing the zaire ebolavirus glycoprotein (vsvδg/zebovgp) in six rhesus macaques infected with simian-human immunodeficiency virus (shiv). all six animals showed no evidence of illness associated with the vsvδg/zebovgp vaccine, suggesting that this vaccine may be safe in immunocompromised populations. while one goal of the study was to evaluate the safety of the candidate vaccine platform, it was also of interest to determine if altered immune status would affect vaccine efficacy. the vaccine protected 4 of 6 shiv-infected macaques from death following zebov challenge. evaluation of cd4+ t cells in all animals showed that the animals that succumbed to lethal zebov challenge had the lowest cd4+ counts, suggesting that cd4+ t cells may play a role in mediating protection against zebov.ebola virus is among the most lethal microbes known to man, with case fatality rates often exceeding 80%. since its discovery in 1976, outbreaks have been sporadic and geographically restricted, primarily to areas of central africa. however, concern about the natural or unnatural introduction of ebola outside of the endemic areas has dramatically increased both research interest and public awareness. a number of candidate vaccines have been developed to combat ebola virus, and these vaccines have shown varying degrees of success in nonhuman primate models. safety is a significant concern for any vaccine and in particular for vaccines that replicate in the host. here, we evaluated the safety of our replication-competent vesicular stomatitus virus (vsv)-based ebola vaccine in shiv-infected rhesus monkeys. we found that the vaccine caused no evidence of overt illness in any of these immunocompromised animals. we also demonstrated that this vaccine partially protected the shiv-infected monkeys against a lethal ebola challenge and that there appears to be an association with levels of cd4+ lymphocytes and survival. our study suggests that the vsv-based ebola vaccine will be safe in immunocompromised populations and supports further study and development of this promising vaccine platform for its use in humans.\n",

      "Abstract: the control of retroviral infection by antiviral factors referred to as restriction factors has become an exciting area in infectious disease research. trim5α has emerged as an important restriction factor impacting on retroviral replication including hiv-1 replication in primates. trim5α has a tripartite motif comprising ring, b-box and coiled coil domains. the antiviral α splice variant additionally encodes a b30.2 domain which is recruited to incoming viral cores and determines antiviral specificity. trim5 is ubiquitinylated and rapidly turned over by the proteasome in a ring dependent way. protecting restricted virus from degradation, by inhibiting the proteasome, rescues dna synthesis, but not infectivity, indicating that restriction of infectivity by trim5α does not depend on the proteasome but the early block to dna synthesis is likely to be mediated by rapid degradation of the restricted cores. the peptidyl prolyl isomerase enzyme cyclophilin a isomerises a peptide bond on the surface of the hiv-1 capsid and impacts on sensitivity to restriction by trim5α from old world monkeys. this suggests that trim5α from old world monkeys might have a preference for a particular capsid isomer and suggests a role for cyclophilin a in innate immunity in general. whether there are more human antiviral trims remains uncertain although the evidence for trim19's (pml) antiviral properties continues to grow. a trim5-like molecule with broad antiviral activity in cattle suggests that trim mediated innate immunity might be common in mammals. certainly the continued study of restriction of viral infectivity by antiviral host factors will remain of interest to a broad audience and impact on a variety of areas including development of animal models for infection, development of viral vectors for gene therapy and the search for novel antiviral drug targets.\n",

      "Abstract: imitative learning has received great attention due to its supposed role in the development of culture and the cognitive demands it poses on the individual. evidence for imitation in non-human primate species, therefore, could shed light on the early origins of proto-cultural traits in the primate order. imitation has been defined as the learning of an act by seeing it done or, more specifically, as the copying of a novel or otherwise improbable act. but despite a century of research and the detection of mirror neurons the empirical basis for this most advanced form of observational learning is weak. few, if any, studies have shown that the observer has learned the response topography, i.e., the specific action by which the response is made. in an experimental set-up we confronted marmoset monkeys (callithrix jacchus) with a conspecific model that was previously trained to open a plastic box in a peculiar way. employing detailed motion analyses we show that the observers precisely copied the movement patterns of the novel action demonstrated by the model. a discriminant analysis classified 13 out of 14 observer movements (92.86%) as model movements and only one as non-observer movement. this evidence of imitation in non-human primates questions the dominant opinion that imitation is a human-specific ability. furthermore, the high matching degree suggests that marmosets possess the neuronal mechanism to code the actions of others and to map them onto their own motor repertoire, rather than priming existing motor-templates.\n",

      "Abstract: we have investigated the pathogenicity of tsetse (glossina pallidipes)-transmitted cloned strains of trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense in vervet monkeys. tsetse flies were confirmed to have mature trypanosome infections by xenodiagnosis, after which nine monkeys were infected via the bite of a single infected fly. chancres developed in five of the nine (55.6%) monkeys within 4 to 8 days post infection (dpi). all nine individuals were successfully infected, with a median pre-patent period of 4 (range = 4–10) days, indicating that trypanosomes migrated from the site of fly bite to the systemic circulation rapidly and independently of the development of the chancre. the time lag to detection of parasites in cerebrospinal fluid (csf) was a median 16 (range = 8–40) days, marking the onset of central nervous system (cns, late) stage disease. subsequently, csf white cell numbers increased above the pre-infection median count of 2 (range = 0–9) cells/µl, with a positive linear association between their numbers and that of csf trypanosomes. haematological changes showed that the monkeys experienced an early microcytic-hypochromic anaemia and severe progressive thrombocytopaenia. despite a 3-fold increase in granulocyte numbers by 4 dpi, leucopaenia occurred early (8 dpi) in the monkey infection, determined mainly by reductions in lymphocyte numbers. terminally, leucocytosis was observed in three of nine (33%) individuals. the duration of infection was a median of 68 (range = 22–120) days. strain and individual differences were observed in the severity of the clinical and clinical pathology findings, with two strains (ketri 3741 and 3801) producing a more acute disease than the other two (ketri 3804 and 3928). the study shows that the fly-transmitted model accurately mimics the human disease and is therefore a suitable gateway to understanding human african trypanosomiasis (hat; sleeping sickness).sleeping sickness is caused by a species of trypanosome blood parasite that is transmitted by tsetse flies. to understand better how infection with this parasite leads to disease, we provide here the most detailed description yet of the course of infection and disease onset in vervet monkeys. one infected tsetse fly was allowed to feed on each host individual, and in all cases infections were successful. the characteristics of infection and disease were similar in all hosts, but the rate of progression varied considerably. parasites were first detected in the blood 4–10 days after infection, showing that migration of parasites from the site of fly bite was very rapid. anaemia was a key feature of disease, with a reduction in the numbers and average size of red blood cells and associated decline in numbers of platelets and white blood cells. one to six weeks after infection, parasites were observed in the cerebrospinal fluid (csf), indicating that they had moved from the blood into the brain; this was associated with a white cell infiltration. this study shows that fly-transmitted infection in vervets accurately mimics human disease and provides a robust model to understand better how sleeping sickness develops.\n",

      "cynomolgus macaques (macaca fascicularis) are a valuable resource for linkage studies of genetic disorders, but their microsatellite markers are not sufficient. in genetic studies, a prerequisite for mapping genes is development of a genome-wide set of microsatellite markers in target organisms. a whole genome sequence and its annotation also facilitate identification of markers for causative mutations. the aim of this study is to establish hundreds of microsatellite markers and to develop an integrative cynomolgus macaque genome database with a variety of datasets including marker and gene information that will be useful for further genetic analyses in this species.\n",
      "results\n",
      "we investigated the level of polymorphisms in cynomolgus monkeys for 671 microsatellite markers that are covered by our established bacterial artificial chromosome (bac) clones. four hundred and ninety-nine (74.4%) of the markers were found to be polymorphic using standard pcr analysis. the average number of alleles and average expected heterozygosity at these polymorphic loci in ten cynomolgus macaques were 8.20 and 0.75, respectively.\n",
      "conclusion\n",
      "bac clones and novel microsatellite markers were assigned to the rhesus genome sequence and linked with our cynomolgus macaque cdna database (qfbase). our novel microsatellite marker set and genomic database will be valuable integrative resources in analyzing genetic disorders in cynomolgus macaques.\n",

      "Title: antigenic variation of cloned plasmodium fragile in its natural host macaca sinica. sequential appearance of successive variant antigenic types\n",
      "Abstract: the course of infection of plasmodium fragile in its natural host, the toque monkey macaca sinica, consists of a primary peak of parasitemia followed by several distinct, successive peaks of lower parasitemia. in the s+ host, the late intraerythrocytic asexual developmental stages of p. fragile induce the expression of antigens on the surface of infected erythrocytes, which could be detected using the technique of surface immunofluorescence. immunofluorescence using unfixed erythrocytes in suspension has shown that antigens are recognized by immune serum on the surface of the erythrocytes infected with more mature stages of the parasite. these antigens undergo variation, each successive peak of parasitemia being characterized by a different variant antigenic type (vat). the appearance of the successive vats occurs in a sequential manner, following the same order in different sets of animals. this constitutes the first example of a sequential expression of antigens in a malaria parasite; it indicates that, in p. fragile, antigenic variation is not the result of random mutations selected by antibody. parasite-induced antigens on the surface of infected erythrocytes could not be detected in the s- host. however, when nonexpressing parasites from the s- host were transferred by blood passage into a naive s+ animal, they began to express antigens on the surface of infected erythrocytes within two erythrocytic cycles. we have demonstrated that the ability of s- parasites to switch to a particular vat when passaged into a s+ animal changes during the course of an infection in the s- animal, indicating that, although surface antigens are not expressed, the processes leading to antigenic variation occurs even in the s- host. antibodies directed against these surface antigens inhibit the growth of intra-erythrocytic parasites. the growth inhibition effects of antibodies are also variant specific, indicating that these variant surface antigens are functionally important for parasite survival.\n",

      "Abstract: acute, acalculous cholecystitis is seen among patients suffering with bacterial sepsis, burns, trauma, or cancer; clinical conditions that could lead to activation of factor xii-dependent pathways and result in inflammation of the gall bladder. to test this hypothesis, dogs were injected intravenously with ellagic acid or rutin, known polyphenol activators of factor xii, or with escherichia coli endotoxin, also known to activate factor xii, and monkeys were injected intravenously with ellagic acid. in both species, in vivo activation of factor xii- dependent pathways with polyphenol activator resulted in rapid and selective development of acute vasculitis in the serosa and muscularis of the gallbladder and margination of polymorphonuclear neutrophils in pulmonary blood vessels. intravenous injection of e. coli endotoxin in dogs resulted in necrosis and thrombosis of vessels that were especially severe in the serosa and muscularis of the gallbladder but also present in vessels of many other organs. these observations indicate that blood vessels of the gall bladder and, to a lesser degree, the lung are especially sensitive to injury consequent to in vivo activation of factor xii-dependent pathways and, in view of the common ingestion of plant polyphenols, may provide important insight into the pathogenesis of cholecystitis in man.\n",

      "Abstract: the surface of erythrocytes infected with late developmental stages of plasmodium falciparum is profoundly altered and new antigenic determinants can be detected by surface immunofluorescence using immune squirrel monkey serum. the expression of these parasite-specific antigenic determinants on the surface of the host erythrocyte can be modulated by the presence or absence of the spleen and by immune pressure. an antigenic switch occurred when a cloned population of the ugandan palo alto strain of p. falciparum was transferred from a splenectomized into an intact monkey and this switch was reversible. in another strain (indochina-1), we showed that the parasites isolated during secondary and recrudescent peaks expressed erythrocyte- associated surface antigens different from the parasites isolated during the primary infection; six variant antigenic types distinct from the original population were isolated in this way. the passive transfer of immune serum can induce antigenic variation and this can occur in a cloned parasite. the various mechanisms of antigenic variation in p. falciparum are discussed in the context of strain-specific diversity and the role of antigenic diversity in acquired immunity.\n",

      "Abstract: background\n",
      "the neocortical commissures have a fundamental role in functional integration across the cerebral hemispheres. we investigated whether commissural projections in prefrontal cortices are organized according to the same or different rules as those within the same hemisphere, by quantitatively comparing density, topography, and laminar origin of contralateral and ipsilateral projections, labeled after unilateral injection of retrograde tracers in prefrontal areas.\n",
      "results\n",
      "commissural projection neurons constituted less than one third of the ipsilateral. nevertheless, projections from the two hemispheres were strongly correlated in topography and relative density. we investigated to what extent the distribution of contralateral projections depended on: (a) geographic proximity of projection areas to the area homotopic to the injection site; (b) the structural type of the linked areas, based on the number and neuronal density of their layers. although both measures were good predictors, structural type was a comparatively stronger determinant of the relative distribution and density of projections. ipsilateral projection neurons were distributed in the superficial (ii-iii) and deep (v-vi) layers, in proportions that varied across areas. in contrast, contralateral projection neurons were found mostly in the superficial layers, but still showed a gradient in their distribution within cortical layers that correlated significantly with cortical type, but not with geographic proximity to the homotopic area.\n",
      "conclusion\n",
      "the organization of ipsilateral and contralateral prefrontal projections is similar in topography and relative density, differing only by higher overall density and more widespread laminar origin of ipsilateral than contralateral projections. the projections on both sides are highly correlated with the structural architecture of the linked areas, and their remarkable organization is likely established by punctuated development of distinct cortical types. the preponderance of contralateral projections from layer iii may be traced to the late development of the callosal system, whose function may be compromised in diseases that have their root late in ontogeny.\n",

      "Abstract: members of transforming growth factor-beta (tgf-β) superfamily play pivotal roles in development in multicellular organisms. we report the functional characterization of the schistosoma mansoni type ii receptor (smtβrii). mining of the s. mansoni expressed sequence tag (est) database identified an est clone that shows homology to the kinase domain of type ii receptors from different species. the amplified est sequence was used as a probe to isolate a cdna clone spanning the entire coding region of a type ii serine/threonine kinase receptor. the interaction of smtβrii with smtβri was elucidated and shown to be dependent on tgf-β ligand binding. furthermore, in the presence of human tgf-β1, smtβrii was able to activate smtβri, which in turn activated smsmad2 and promoted its interaction with smsmad4, proving the transfer of the signal from the receptor complex to the smad proteins. gynaecophoral canal protein (gcp), whose expression in male worms is limited to the gynaecophoric canal, was identified as a potential tgf-β target gene in schistosomes. knocking down the expression of smtβrii using short interfering rna molecules (sirna) resulted in a concomitant reduction in the expression of gcp. these data provide evidence for the direct involvement of smtβrii in mediating tgf-β–induced activation of the tgf-β target gene, smgcp, within schistosome parasites. the results also provide additional evidence for a role for the tgf-β signaling pathway in male-induced female reproductive development.schistosomes are multicellular parasites that infect 200 million people worldwide. schistosome development in the human host likely involves host molecules that regulate biological processes of the parasite. members of transforming growth factor-beta (tgf-β) superfamily play pivotal roles in development in multicellular organisms. tgf-β signaling requires ligand binding to a specific surface receptor, tgf-β type ii receptor. the authors isolated the schistosome tgf-β type ii receptor (smtβrii), which was found to be biologically active and responded to stimulation by host tgf-β. the gynaecophoric canal is a ventral groove in the male worm in which the female must reside for sexual maturity. gynaecophoral canal protein (gcp) is a protein whose expression in male worms is limited to the gynaecophoric canal and is implicated in female reproductive maturation. gcp expression was found to be regulated by human tgf-β. knocking down the expression of smtβrii resulted in a concomitant reduction in the expression of gcp, providing evidence for the direct involvement of smtβrii-mediated, host tgf-β–induced regulation of schistosome gene expression. this study implicates the tgf-β signaling pathway in worm pairing, a prerequisite for female egg production. because the eggs produced by the worm pairs are responsible for pathogenesis, the authors' research identifies potential targets for intervention.\n",

      "we studied the release of glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (gpi)-anchored proteins of s. mansoni and found them in the circulation associated with host lipoprotein particles. host cells endocytosed schistosomal gpi-anchored proteins via their lipoprotein receptor pathway, resulting in disturbed lysosome morphology. in patients suffering from chronic schistosomiasis, antibodies attacked the parasite gpi-anchored glycoproteins that were associated with the patients' own lipoprotein particles. these immunocomplexes were endocytosed by cells carrying an immunoglobulin-fc receptor, leading to clearance of lipoproteins by the immune system. as a consequence, neutral lipids accumulated in neutrophils of infected hamsters and in human neutrophils incubated with patient serum, and this accumulation was associated with apoptosis and reduced neutrophil viability. also, trypanosoma brucei, the parasite that causes sleeping sickness, released its major gpi-anchored glycoprotein vsg221 on lipoprotein particles, demonstrating that this process is generalizable to other pathogens/parasites.\n",

      "Abstract: background\n",
      "the function of voltage-gated calcium (cav) channels greatly depends on coupling to cytoplasmic accessory β subunits, which not only promote surface expression, but also modulate gating and kinetic properties of the α1 subunit. schistosomes, parasitic platyhelminths that cause schistosomiasis, express two β subunit subtypes: a structurally conventional β subunit and a variant β subunit with unusual functional properties. we have previously characterized the functional properties of the variant cavβ subunit. here, we focus on the modulatory phenotype of the conventional cavβ subunit (smcavβ) using the human cav2.3 channel as the substrate for smcavβ and the whole-cell patch-clamp technique.\n",
      "results\n",
      "the conventional schistosoma mansoni cavβ subunit markedly increases cav2.3 currents, slows macroscopic inactivation and shifts steady state inactivation in the hyperpolarizing direction. however, currents produced by cav2.3 in the presence of smcavβ run-down to approximately 75% of their initial amplitudes within two minutes of establishing the whole-cell configuration. this suppressive effect was independent of ca2+, but dependent on intracellular mg2+-atp. additional experiments revealed that smcavβ lends the cav2.3/smcavβ complex sensitivity to na+ ions. a mutant version of the cavβ subunit lacking the first forty-six amino acids, including a string of twenty-two acidic residues, no longer conferred sensitivity to intracellular mg2+-atp and na+ ions, while continuing to show wild type modulation of current amplitude and inactivation of cav2.3.\n",

      "Abstract: background\n",
      "helminth infections are prevalent in rural areas of developing countries and have in some studies been negatively associated with allergic disorders and atopy. in this context little is known of the molecular mechanisms of modulation involved. we have characterized the innate immune responses, at the molecular level, in children according to their helminth infection status and their atopic reactivity to allergens.\n",

      "the mrna expression of several genes of the innate immune system that have been associated with microbial exposure and allergy was examined in 120 school children in a rural area in ghana. helminth infections were common and atopy rare in the study area. the analysis of gene expression in ex vivo whole blood samples reflected the levels of corresponding proteins. using this approach in a population of school children in whom the presence of schistosoma haematobium infection was associated with protection from atopic reactivity, we found that the level of tlr2 and socs-3, genes associated with atopy in the children, were significantly downregulated by presence of s. haematobium infection.\n",

      "methodology/principal findings\n",
      "over a 2-year period, using a molecular epidemiological approach, we examined spatial and temporal distributions, and the overlap of these schistosomes within snails, in natural settings in kenya. both species had spatially and temporally patchy distributions, although s. mansoni was eight times more common than s. rodhaini. both species were overdispersed within snails, and most snails (85.2% for s. mansoni and 91.7% for s. rodhaini) only harbored one schistosome genotype. over time, half of snails infected with multiple genotypes showed a replacement pattern in which an initially dominant genotype was less represented in later replicates. the other half showed a consistent pattern over time; however, the ratio of each genotype was skewed. profiles of circadian emergence of cercariae revealed that s. rodhaini emerges throughout the 24-hour cycle, with peak emergence before sunrise and sometimes immediately after sunset, which differs from previous reports of a single nocturnal peak immediately after sunset. peak emergence for s. mansoni cercariae occurred as light became most intense and overlapped temporally with s. rodhaini. comparison of schistosome communities within snails against a null model indicated that the community was structured and that coinfections were more common than expected by chance. in mixed infections, cercarial emergence over 24 hours remained similar to single species infections, again with s. rodhaini and s. mansoni cercarial emergence profiles overlapping substantially.\n",

      "Abstract: schistosomes are parasitic worms that infect hundreds of millions of people in developing countries. they cause disease by virtue of the fact that the eggs that they produce, which are intended for release from the host in order to allow transmission of infection, can become trapped in target organs such as the liver, where they induce damaging inflammation. egg production by female schistosomes is critically dependent on the presence of male parasites, without which females never fully develop, and (counterintuitively) on the contribution of signals from the host's immune system. very little is understood about the molecular basis of these interactions. here, we describe a newly discovered schistosome gene, which is expressed in the reproductive tract of the female parasite and in parasite eggs. the protein encoded by this gene is made only when females are paired with males in an immunologically competent setting. using recently developed tools that allow gene function to be inhibited in schistosomes, we show that the product of this gene plays a crucial role in egg development. examining how the expression of this gene is controlled has the potential to provide insight into the molecular nature of the interactions between male and female parasites and their hosts. moreover, the pivotal role of this gene in the egg makes it a potential target for blocking transmission and disease development.\n",

      "here, we provide fresh perspective on the molecular basis of praziquantel efficacy in vivo consequent to the discovery of a remarkable action of pzq on regeneration in a species of free-living flatworm (dugesia japonica). specifically, pzq caused a robust (100% penetrance) and complete duplication of the entire anterior-posterior axis during flatworm regeneration to yield two-headed organisms with duplicated, integrated central nervous and organ systems. exploiting this phenotype as a readout for proteins impacting praziquantel efficacy, we demonstrate that pzq-evoked bipolarity was selectively ablated by in vivo rnai of voltage-operated calcium channel (vocc) β subunits, but not by knockdown of a vocc α subunit. at higher doses of pzq, knockdown of vocc β subunits also conferred resistance to pzq in lethality assays.\n",
      "conclusions\n",
      "this study identifies a new biological activity of the antischistosomal drug praziquantel on regenerative polarity in a species of free-living flatworm. ablation of the bipolar regenerative phenotype evoked by pzq via in vivo rnai of vocc β subunits provides the first genetic evidence implicating a molecular target crucial for in vivo pzq activity and supports the ‘vocc hypothesis’ of pzq efficacy. further, in terms of regenerative biology and ca2+ signaling, these data highlight a novel role for voltage-operated ca2+ entry in regulating in vivo stem cell differentiation and regenerative patterning.\n",

      "Abstract: schistosomiasis is a prevalent and chronic helmintic disease in tropical regions. treatment and control relies on chemotherapy with just one drug, praziquantel and this reliance is of concern should clinically relevant drug resistance emerge and spread. therefore, to identify potential target proteins for new avenues of drug discovery we have taken a comparative chemogenomics approach utilizing the putative proteome of schistosoma mansoni compared to the proteomes of two model organisms, the nematode, caenorhabditis elegans and the fruitfly, drosophila melanogaster. using the genome comparison software genlight, two separate in silico workflows were implemented to derive a set of parasite proteins for which gene disruption of the orthologs in both the model organisms yielded deleterious phenotypes (e.g., lethal, impairment of motility), i.e., are essential genes/proteins. of the 67 and 68 sequences generated for each workflow, 63 were identical in both sets, leading to a final set of 72 parasite proteins. all but one of these were expressed in the relevant developmental stages of the parasite infecting humans. subsequent in depth manual curation of the combined workflow output revealed 57 candidate proteins. scrutiny of these for ‘druggable’ protein homologs in the literature identified 35 s. mansoni sequences, 18 of which were homologous to proteins with 3d structures including co-crystallized ligands that will allow further structure-based drug design studies. the comparative chemogenomics strategy presented generates a tractable set of s. mansoni proteins for experimental validation as drug targets against this insidious human pathogen.\n",

      "conclusion\n",
      "the presence of a p2x receptor in a tardigrade species suggests that both nematodes and arthropods lost their p2x genes independently, as both traditional and molecular phylogenies place the divergence between nematoda and arthropoda before their divergence from tardigrada. the phylogenetic analysis performed in our study also clearly demonstrates that the emergence of the family of seven p2x channels in human and other mammalian species was a relatively recent evolutionary event that occurred subsequent to the split between vertebrates and invertebrates. furthermore, several characteristics of hdp2x including fast kinetics with low atp sensitivity, potentiation by ivermectin in a channel with fast kinetics and distinct copper and zinc binding sites not dependent on histidines make hdp2x a useful model for comparative structure-function studies allowing a better understanding of p2x receptors in higher organisms.\n",

      "Abstract: decay-accelerating factor (daf) is a 70-kd membrane glycoprotein that prevents complement (c)-mediated hemolysis by blocking the assembly or accelerating the decay of c3 convertase. purified daf is known to incorporate into the membrane of daf-deficient cells, inhibiting lysis. since schistosoma mansoni is a blood-dwelling parasite, we investigated whether daf can be transferred from human erythrocytes to the worm and protect it against c-mediated killing in vitro. we have found that schistosomula (schla) incubated with normal human erythrocytes (n-hue), but not with daf-deficient erythrocytes, become resistant to c damage in vitro. protected parasites acquire a 70-kd surface protein which can be immunoprecipitated by anti-daf antibodies. the acquired resistance is abrogated by treatment of n-hue-incubated parasites with anti-daf antibody. these results indicate that, in vitro, n-hue daf can be transferred to schla, and suggest its participation in preventing their c-mediated killing. this could represent an important strategy of parasites to evade the host's immune response in vivo.\n",

      "Title: downregulation of th1 cytokine production accompanies induction of th2 responses by a parasitic helminth, schistosoma mansoni\n",
      "Abstract: in the mouse, infection with schistosoma mansoni results in an egg- producing infection and associated disease, whereas vaccination with attenuated larval stages produces a substantial and specific immunity in the absence of egg-induced pathology. preliminary data showing enhanced interleukin-5 (il-5) production by t cells from infected mice and interferon gamma (ifn-gamma) synthesis by cells from vaccinated animals (7), suggested differential cd4+ subset stimulation by the different parasite stimuli. to confirm this hypothesis, lymphocytes from vaccinated or infected animals were compared for their ability to produce ifn-gamma and il-2 (secreted by th1 cells) as compared with il- 4 and il-5 (characteristic th2 cytokines). after stimulation with specific antigen or mitogen, t cells from vaccinated mice or prepatently infected animals responded primarily with th1 lymphokines, whereas lymphocytes from patently infected mice instead produced th2 cytokines. the th2 response in infected animals was shown to be induced by schistosome eggs and directed largely against egg antigens, whereas the th1 reactivity in vaccinated mice was triggered primarily by larval antigens. interestingly, th1 responses in mice carrying egg-producing infections were found to be profoundly downregulated. moreover, the injection of eggs into vaccinated mice resulted in a reduction of antigen and mitogen-stimulated th1 function accompanied by a coincident expression of th2 responses. together, the data suggest that coincident with the induction of th2 responses, murine schistosome infection results in an inhibition of potentially protective th1 function. this previously unrecognized downregulation of th1 cytokine production may be an important immunological consequence of helminth infection related to host adaptation.\n",

      "Title: studies on experimental rickets \n",
      "Abstract: our observations show that young rabbits born of mothers afflicted with schistosomum japonicum develop typical rickets. rickets can also be produced if we infect the young, healthy rabbits with the same parasite. it is natural to suppose that the rachitic changes are caused by the parasite itself. since, however, a similar disease can be produced in the offspring, when the mother is fed on egg yolk, the causation is not limited to the action of this parasitic toxin alone. the toxin of schistosoma may disturb the calcium and phosphorus metabolism of bone in young animals, especially in the period of vigorous growth; that is, 20 to 40 days after birth of the rabbits. or it may exhaust some element important in the calcium and phosphorus metabolism such as vitamin a or d. the fact that exhaustion of the antirachitic factor in the mother causes rickets in the young, as grant (1924) showed, and that certain low grade infections can exhaust vitamin b as shown by wedgewood (1924), is in line with this conception. it may be added here that most investigations on rickets have been carried out on rats and dogs. we have found a simple and excellent way of producing rickets in rabbits by dietary deficiency. concerning this method, we shall report elsewhere.\n",

      "Abstract: schistosomiasis is among the most prevalent parasitic infections worldwide. however, current global burden of disease (gbd) disability-adjusted life year estimates indicate that its population-level impact is negligible. recent studies suggest that gbd methodologies may significantly underestimate the burden of parasitic diseases, including schistosomiasis. furthermore, strain-specific disability weights have not been established for schistosomiasis, and the magnitude of human disease burden due to schistosoma japonicum remains controversial. we used a decision model to quantify an alternative disability weight estimate of the burden of human disease due to s. japonicum. we reviewed s. japonicum morbidity data, and constructed decision trees for all infected persons and two age-specific strata, <15 years (y) and ≥15 y. we conducted stochastic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses for each model. infection with s. japonicum was associated with an average disability weight of 0.132, with age-specific disability weights of 0.098 (<15 y) and 0.186 (≥15 y). re-estimated disability weights were seven to 46 times greater than current gbd measures; no simulations produced disability weight estimates lower than 0.009. nutritional morbidities had the greatest contribution to the s. japonicum disability weight in the <15 y model, whereas major organ pathologies were the most critical variables in the older age group. gbd disability weights for schistosomiasis urgently need to be revised, and species-specific disability weights should be established. even a marginal increase in current estimates would result in a substantial rise in the estimated global burden of schistosomiasis, and have considerable implications for public health prioritization and resource allocation for schistosomiasis research, monitoring, and control.schistosomiasis is a parasitic infection caused by a flatworm that disproportionately affects the world's poorest populations. schistosomiasis is one of the most common infections worldwide, affecting over 207 million people in 76 countries. current international estimates indicate that schistosomiasis has a minimal impact at the population level. this has contributed to its low prioritization in global health and subsequent resource allocation for disease control. however, recent studies indicate that these measures underestimate the extent of neglected tropical diseases, including schistosomiasis. despite world health organization recommendations, the burden of schistosomiasis has not been re-examined in over a decade, and there are no established estimates for different types of schistosomiasis. the impact of symptoms associated with the asian strain, schistosoma japonicum, remains controversial. this study was conducted to provide an alternate measure of the burden of s. japonicum. we reviewed the literature and calculated a summary estimate for s. japonicum which was seven to 46 times greater than current measures for schistosomiasis. findings suggest that current measures severely underestimate the extent of schistosomiasis, and urgently need to be revised. further research is needed to examine the burden of schistosomiasis and other forgotten tropical diseases affecting the world's poorest people in endemic countries.\n",

      "Abstract: cationic amino acid transporters (cat) are important regulators of nos2 and arg1 activity because they regulate l-arginine availability. however, their role in the development of th1/th2 effector functions following infection has not been investigated. here we dissect the function of cat2 by studying two infectious disease models characterized by the development of polarized th1 or th2-type responses. we show that cat2−/− mice are significantly more susceptible to the th1-inducing pathogen toxoplasma gondii. although t. gondii infected cat2−/− mice developed stronger ifn-γ responses, nitric oxide (no) production was significantly impaired, which contributed to their enhanced susceptibility. in contrast, cat2−/− mice infected with the th2-inducing pathogen schistosoma mansoni displayed no change in susceptibility to infection, although they succumbed to schistosomiasis at an accelerated rate. granuloma formation and fibrosis, pathological features regulated by th2 cytokines, were also exacerbated even though their th2 response was reduced. finally, while il-13 blockade was highly efficacious in wild-type mice, the development of fibrosis in cat2−/− mice was largely il-13-independent. instead, the exacerbated pathology was associated with increased arginase activity in fibroblasts and alternatively activated macrophages, both in vitro and in vivo. thus, by controlling nos2 and arginase activity, cat2 functions as a potent regulator of immunity.recent studies conducted with amino transporter slc7a2-deficient mice (cat2) demonstrated that nos2 activity in macrophages is regulated by cat2. nos2, which synthesizes nitric oxide, regulates numerous important activities, including resistance to infectious organisms, tumor development, and autoimmune diseases. it also competes with the enzyme arginase-1 (arg1) for the common substrate l-arginine. however, the role cat2 in the regulation of arg1 activity has not been previously examined. therefore, we infected cat2-deficient mice with the helminth parasite schistosoma mansoni or with the protozoan pathogen toxoplasma gondii, two organisms that trigger highly divergent host immune responses. strikingly, following infection with s. mansoni, cat2−/− mice developed parasite egg–induced lesions in the liver that were 3 to 4 times larger than wild type and hepatic fibrosis (a feature of severe schistosomiasis) was exacerbated, indicating a general worsening of disease in the absence of cat2. the cat2−/− mice were also more susceptible to t. gondii infection, demonstrating that cat2 is critical for the development of protective cell-mediated immunity. thus, these studies identify cat2 as a powerful regulator of host immune responses, which may have major implications for a variety of infectious, inflammatory, and autoimmune diseases.\n",

      "Abstract: schistosoma egg-induced liver granuloma is a dynamic inflammatory reaction that results from complex immune responses to the infection. however, the role of b cells in inflammatory granuloma development is not yet fully understood. we report here that b cell function is required for s. japonicum egg-induced granuloma pathology in early infection. both obf-1 knockout mice and µmt mice develop severely reduced hepatic granulomas at five weeks post-infection compared to their wild-type counterparts. in contrast, they display no significant difference in granuloma pathology at eight weeks post-infection. moreover, we find that b cells and antibodies accumulate in the granulomas of wild-type mice early in the infection, indicating a contribution of the b cell response to the granulomatous inflammation. furthermore, defects in b cell function markedly reduce liver egg burden. these results suggest an important role for b cells in early granuloma pathology. surprisingly, we found that the s. japonicum infection destroys the structure of the lymphoid follicles. this disruptive effect is correlated with a severely impaired t cell-dependent antibody response upon challenge with ovalbumin. thus, these findings reveal a novel aspect of the interaction between schistosoma and the host immune system.\n",

      "Abstract: background\n",
      "schistosomiasis is a chronic, debilitating parasitic disease infecting more than 200 million people and is second only to malaria in terms of public health importance. due to the lack of a vaccine, patient therapy is heavily reliant on chemotherapy with praziquantel as the world health organization–recommended drug, but concerns over drug resistance encourage the search for new drug leads.\n",
      "methods and findings\n",
      "the efficacy of the vinyl sulfone cysteine protease inhibitor k11777 was tested in the murine model of schistosomiasis mansoni. disease parameters measured were worm and egg burdens, and organ pathology including hepato- and splenomegaly, presence of parasite egg–induced granulomas in the liver, and levels of circulating alanine aminotransferase activity as a marker of hepatocellular function. k11777 (25 mg/kg twice daily [bid]), administered intraperitoneally at the time of parasite migration through the skin and lungs (days 1–14 postinfection [p.i.]), resulted in parasitologic cure (elimination of parasite eggs) in five of seven cases and a resolution of other disease parameters. k11777 (50 mg/kg bid), administered at the commencement of egg-laying by mature parasites (days 30–37 p.i.), reduced worm and egg burdens, and ameliorated organ pathology. using protease class-specific substrates and active-site labeling, one molecular target of k11777 was identified as the gut-associated cathepsin b1 cysteine protease, although other cysteine protease targets are not excluded. in rodents, dogs, and primates, k11777 is nonmutagenic with satisfactory safety and pharmacokinetic profiles.\n",

      "background.\n",
      "schistosomiasis, a disease caused by a type of parasitic flatworm that lives in the blood, infects around 200 million people worldwide. the disease is a serious problem in sub-saharan africa, south america, china, and southeast asia. although this disease can kill, it is better known as a lifelong chronic infection with debilitating symptoms mainly due to an immune reaction raised against parasite eggs trapped in the liver, spleen, and gut. the worm's life cycle is complicated and involves a free-swimming form that emerges from certain types of snails that live in lakes and ponds. this can penetrate the skin of people in contact with the water. after a period spent in the skin and around the lungs, the parasites move to veins around the gut, and develop into adult worms that mate and lay eggs. these eggs eventually return to the water through the person's feces or urine. a particular group of proteins called cysteine proteases are thought to be very important in the biology of these worms, especially in their function as digestive enzymes in the parasite's gut. these proteases could represent an exciting opportunity for development of new drugs to treat schistosomiasis. the researchers are looking at whether it is possible to block the activity of cysteine proteases and, as a result, kill the worms or prevent them from developing and thriving.\n",
      "why was this study done?\n",
      "at the moment there is only one drug, praziquantel, in common use for treatment of schistosomiasis; it is cheap and effective. however many organizations are worried about relying on a single drug to treat a serious disease which affects so many people worldwide. the research group here has been looking at molecules that block cysteine protease activity, to see if any of these could be good drug candidates for schistosomiasis. one molecule they have been looking at goes by the name of k11777, which is under evaluation as a drug candidate for another parasitic infection (chagas' disease). here, the researchers wanted to find out whether k11777 had any activity against schistosome worms.\n",
      "what did the researchers do and find?\n",
      "in this study, the researchers deliberately infected laboratory mice with the schistosome parasite. these mice were then either injected with k11777 solution twice daily, or with equivalent volumes of water as a comparison. the researchers examined the effects of injecting k11777 either “early” in infection (using a 14 day course, starting 1 day after infection with the parasite) or “late” in the worms' development (using an 8 day treatment course starting 30 days after infection). the outcomes used as measures of success of treatment with k11777 included the number of worms recovered from mice after euthanasia, the number of worm eggs counted in the liver; the extent of the damage to the liver; and finally, the researchers also looked at activity levels of cysteine proteases in the worms themselves, in particular, those proteases associated with the parasite gut.the results of the early-treatment experiment showed a substantial decrease in worm numbers and egg production. in five of the seven mice treated, eggs were eliminated entirely. also, there was little measurable liver damage. for the late-treatment experiment, decreased burdens of worms and eggs in the livers of k11777 treated mice were also found, and there was less damage to the livers. those worms surviving treatment and removed from mice also had much less activity of gut cysteine proteases suggesting that k11777 exerts its effects by targeting worm cysteine proteases.\n",
      "what do these findings mean?\n",
      "these experiments show that k11777 is a potent antischistosomal agent in mice. it might therefore be a good ‘candidate' molecule for developing future treatments for human schistosomiasis. however, before that stage can be reached, it would be important to carry out clinical trials to test whether k11777 is both safe and effective in schistosomiasis patients. full details as to which worm cysteine protease(s) is the critical target of k11777 would also need to be worked out, and more information would be needed as to whether the dosing plan used in this study (twice-daily injections for a week to 14 days) can be decreased.\n",

      "Abstract: this study intended to characterize pharmacologically the mediator(s) released in the inflammation induced by soluble egg antigen (sea), the main antigen released from eggs of schistosoma mansoni, in rat hindpaws. a single intraplantar injection of 0.1-100 microg sea at day zero induced a dose-dependent increase in the volume of rat hindpaws characterizing an oedema of quick onset (within 15 min) and 4h-duration, which was confirmed by histopathological analysis of the paws. a second injection of sea in the same paw (1-10 microg) 28 days later induced an increased dose-dependent oedematogenic response. the early oedematogenic response following sea sensitization was derived from serotonin release and interleukin-1 (il-1), since treatment with either pizotifen or an antibody against il-1, reduced the response by 60% and 48%, respectively. the increased oedematogenic response derived from sea-challenge (10 microg) of rat paws derived from a local rather than systemic reaction, since it was not observed if the sensitization was in the contralateral paw or the peritoneal cavity of the animals. chronic treatment with inhibitors of il-2 synthesis/release such as cyclosporin or dexamethasone during the sensitization phase reduced the oedematogenic response due to sea challenge by 51% and 55%, respectively. these data suggested that sea-challenge was immune-derived and dependent of il-2 release. it is discussed the association between cytokine release and the resistance of rats to s. mansoni infection.\n",

      "Abstract: background: aging is associated with several alterations in the phenotype, repertoire and activation status of lymphocytes as well as in the cytokine profile produced by these cells. as a lifelong condition, chronic parasitic diseases such as human schistosomiasis overlaps with the aging process and no systematic study has yet addressed the changes in immune response during infection with schistosoma mansoni in older individuals. aim: herein we study the influence of immunological alterations brought about by senescence in the course of schistosomiasis. materials and methods: individuals 10-95 years of age, from both sexes, from an endemic area for s. mansoni infection were matched by intensity of infection as measured by egg counts. we analyzed, as a parameter, cytokine expression by lymphocytes and natural killer cells after in vitro stimulation with soluble egg antigen and soluble worm antigen using flow cytometry. results: we demonstrated that the frequency of cd16+ interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma)+ natural killer cells in negative individuals over the age of 70 years is significantly higher than in positive individuals after in vitro stimulation with s. mansoni antigen extracts. the frequency of these cells is increased in all individuals over the age of 50 years and only declines in positive individuals after 70 years of age. analysis of either cd4? or cd8? cells after antigen stimulation show no significant increase in frequency of ifn-gamma in negative or in positive individuals of this age group, suggesting that the effect on cd16+ cells is not t-cell dependent. conclusion: since production of ifn-gamma has been related to resistance to schistosome infection, our data suggest that age-associated changes in cd16+ cells may play a role in controlling infection intensity in the elderly in s. mansoni endemic areas of brazil.\n",

      "methodology/principal findings\n",
      "known amounts of s. mansoni eggs were seeded into 30 g of normal human feces and subjected to a sequence of spontaneous sedimentation, sieving, ritchie method, incubation and isolation through interaction with paramagnetic beads. preliminary tests demonstrated the efficacy of lectins as ligands, but they also indicated that the paramagnetic beads alone were sufficient to isolate the eggs under a magnetic field through an unknown mechanism. eggs were identified by microscopic inspection, with a sensitivity of 100% at 1.3 eggs per gram of feces (epg). sensitivity gradually decreased to 25% at a concentration of 0.1 epg. in a preliminary application of the new method to the investigation of a recently established focus in southern brazil, approximately 3 times more eggs were detected than with the thick-smear kato-katz method.\n",

      "results\n",
      "a total of 1427 households and 6917 individuals agreed to participate in the study. a total of 5624 (81.3%) participants provided at least one stool sample. the prevalences of those lightly and at least moderately infected varied from 0% (95% bayesian credible interval (bci): 0%–3.1%) to 45.2% (95% bci: 36.5%–53.9%) and 0% to 23.0% (95% bci: 16.4%–31.2%) from village-to-village, respectively. using the 0–7 year old group as a reference category, the highest odds ratio (or) among males and females were that of being aged 17–40-year old (or = 8.76; 95% bci: 6.03–12.47) and 11–16-year old (or = 8.59; 95% bci: 4.74–14.28), respectively. people who did not work on a rice farm had a lower prevalence of infection than those working full time on a rice farm. the or for irrigated villages compared to rain-fed villages was 1.41 (95% bci: 0.50–3.21).\n",

      "Abstract: schistosomiasis remains a serious public health problem with an estimated 200 million people infected in 76 countries. here we isolated ~ 8,400 potential protein-encoding cdna contigs from schistosoma japonicum after sequencing circa 84,000 expressed sequence tags. in tandem, we undertook a high-throughput proteomics approach to characterize the protein expression profiles of a number of developmental stages (cercariae, hepatic schistosomula, female and male adults, eggs, and miracidia) and tissues at the host-parasite interface (eggshell and tegument) by interrogating the protein database deduced from the contigs. comparative analysis of these transcriptomic and proteomic data, the latter including 3,260 proteins with putative identities, revealed differential expression of genes among the various developmental stages and sexes of s. japonicum and localization of putative secretory and membrane antigens, enzymes, and other gene products on the adult tegument and eggshell, many of which displayed genetic polymorphisms. numerous s. japonicum genes exhibited high levels of identity with those of their mammalian hosts, whereas many others appeared to be conserved only across the genus schistosoma or phylum platyhelminthes. these findings are expected to provide new insights into the pathophysiology of schistosomiasis and for the development of improved interventions for disease control and will facilitate a more fundamental understanding of schistosome biology, evolution, and the host-parasite interplay.schistosomiasis remains a major public health problem in the developing world. schistosoma japonicum, the oriental blood fluke, causes intestinal schistosomiasis in china and the philippines. knowledge of the genome and proteome of this worm should improve understanding of biomedical aspects of schistosomiasis. this study represents the first major attempt to characterize the majority of the expressed genes and proteins of a human blood fluke through rigorous, high-throughput genomic and proteomic methodologies. the findings of this study provide a unique resource of numerous schistosome genes and information on protein profiles of the different developmental stages of s. japonicum. many of the newly discovered proteins are localized on the surface of the worm and its eggs, and they are likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of schistosomiasis. furthermore, genetic variants found in many of these new genes likely reflect the ability of this important human pathogen to adapt and respond to environmental pressures and the capacity of the parasite to respond to anti-schistosomal therapies. comparison of these s. japonicum genes with those from mammals and other organisms will facilitate advances in the understanding of blood fluke biology and evolution.\n",

      "Abstract: background\n",
      "schistosoma japonicum is a major public health concern in china, with over one million people infected and another 40 million living in areas at risk of infection. unlike the disease caused by s. mansoni and s. haematobium, schistosomiasis japonica is a zoonosis, involving a number of different mammalian species as reservoir hosts. as a result of a number of published reports from china, it has long been considered that bovines, particularly water buffaloes, play a major role in human s. japonicum transmission there, and a drug-based intervention study (1998–2003) around the poyang lake in jiangxi province provided proof of concept that water buffaloes are, indeed, major reservoirs of human infection in this setting.\n",
      "methods and findings\n",
      "in this study we incorporated recently obtained epidemiological information to model the steady-state s. japonicum transmission as well as the impact of the removal of s. japonicum transmission attributable to water buffaloes on human infection rates across six different endemic scenarios within three villages in the dongting (hunan) and poyang (jiangxi) lakes of southern china. similar results were obtained for all scenarios. steady-state s. japonicum infection rates remained constant and human prevalence and incidence were predicted to fall considerably over time. the model showed that the contribution of s. japonicum water buffalo transmission to human infection ranged from 39.1% to 99.1% and predicted that the removal of water buffalo transmission would reduce parasite reproductive rates below 1. this indicates that without the contribution of water buffaloes, s. japonicum transmission is interrupted and unsustainable. these scenarios are generalizable to other endemic villages in the lake and marshland areas of china where a similar cycle of snail infection and infection/reinfection of humans and bovines occurs.\n",
      "conclusions\n",
      "along with previous epidemiological data, our findings strongly support water buffaloes as an important component of the transmission cycle that affects humans in the lake and marshlands region of china, a feature which appears to differ from the situation prevalent in the philippines where their contribution is less pronounced. our conclusions underscore the rationale for removal, replacement or treatment of water buffaloes, and for the development and deployment of a transmission blocking buffalo vaccine against s. japonicum for this setting to achieve the goal of transmission control. the chinese government has recently commenced a new integrated national strategy to improve on existing approaches to control schistosomiasis in the lake and marshlands region by reducing bovines and humans as a source of s. japonicum infection to oncomelania snails.\n",

      "Abstract: despite great strides in their control throughout the people's republic of china, helminth infections remain an important public health problem. the institute of parasitic diseases of the chinese academy of preventive medicine, under the guidance of the chinese ministry of health, completed a nationwide survey of more than 1 million people that showed the high prevalence and intensity of intestinal nematode infections; prevalence can sometimes exceed 50% in the yangtze river valley provinces. schistosoma japonicum is also a major cause of illness in this region. attempts to control chinese helminthic diseases with conventional anthelminthic drugs have been partially thwarted by high posttreatment rates of reinfection. recently, several new human trematode pathogens have been identified. novel approaches to chemoprophylaxis and vaccination may alleviate the public health problem caused by chinese helminths. however, recombinant helminth vaccine development will depend on first cataloguing the extensive genetic diversity of chinese helminths and candidate vaccine antigens. evidence from biogeography, genetics, and systematics suggests that the genetic diversification of chinese helminths and their vectors is an ongoing evolutionary process that began 12 million years ago near the convergence of major asian river systems. construction of the three gorges super dam on the yangtze river may promote the emergence and reemergence of new helminths and their snail vectors\n",

      "Abstract: a transcriptional product of a gene encoding cathepsin b-like peptidase in the bird schistosome trichobilharzia regenti was identified and cloned. the enzyme was named trcb2 due to its 77% sequence similarity to cathepsin b2 from the important human parasite schistosoma mansoni. the zymogen was expressed in the methylotropic yeast pichia pastoris; procathepsin b2 underwent self-processing in yeast media. the peptidolytic activity of the recombinant enzyme was characterised using synthetic fluorogenic peptide substrates at optimal ph 6.0. functional studies using different specific inhibitors proved the typical cathepsin b-like nature of the enzyme. the s2 subsite specificity profile of recombinant trcb2 was obtained. using monospecific antibodies against the recombinant enzyme, the presence of cathepsin b2 was confirmed in extracts from cercariae (infective stage) and schistosomula (early post-cercarial stage) of t. regenti on western blots. also, cross-reactivity was observed between t. regenti and s. mansoni cathepsins b2 in extracts of cercariae, schistosomula or adults. in t. regenti, the antisera localised the enzyme to post-acetabular penetration glands of cercariae implying an important role in the penetration of host skin. the ability of recombinant trcb2 to degrade skin, serum and nervous tissue proteins was evident. elastinolytic activity suggests that the enzyme might functionally substitute the histolytic role of the serine class elastase known from s. mansoni and schistosoma haematobium but not found in schistosoma japonicum or in bird schistosomes.\n",

      "Abstract: we have employed in situ hybridization to evaluate the molecular mechanisms responsible for hypoalbuminemia and increased liver collagen content in murine schistosomiasis. results were compared using a simplified method of hybridizing isolated hepatocytes from schistosoma mansoni-infected and normal mouse liver with mouse albumin (pmalb-2) and chick pro-alpha 2(l) collagen (pcg45) probes. whereas hepatocytes from infected mice showed significantly less albumin mrna than hepatocytes from control, there were more grains of procollagen mrna in hepatocytes from infected as compared with control liver. hybridization of infected liver tissue sections with the collagen probe showed more grains per field in granulomas than in liver regions, whereas with the albumin probe there was more hybridization in liver tissue than in granulomas. these results suggest that in murine schistosomiasis a reduction in albumin mrna sequence content may be associated with decreased albumin synthesis and ultimately leads to hypoalbuminemia. in addition, although the granuloma seems to be the primary source of type i collagen synthesis, hepatocytes are also capable of synthesizing collagen, especially under fibrogenic stimulation.\n",

      "Abstract: cercariae, the freshwater stage of schistosoma mansoni infectious to man, are covered by a single unit membrane and an immunogenic glycocalyx. when cercariae penetrate the host skin, they transform to schistosomula by shedding tails, secreting mucous and enzymes, and forming microvilli over their surface. here the loss of the glycocalyx from cercariae transforming in vitro was studied morphologically and biochemically. by scanning electron microscopy, the glycocalyx was a dense mesh composed of 15-30 nm fibrils that obscured spines on the cercarial surface. the glycocalyx was absent on organisms fixed without osmium and was partially lost when parasites aggregated in their own secretions before fixation. by transmission electron microscopy, a 1-2 microns thick mesh of 8-15-nm fibrils was seen on parasites incubated with anti-schistosomal antibodies or fixed in aldehydes containing tannic acid or ruthenium red. cercariae transformed to schistosomula when tails were removed mechanically and parasites were incubated in saline. within 5 min of transformation, organisms synchronously formed microvilli which elongated to 3-5 microns by 20 min and then were shed. however, considerable fibrillar material remained adherent to the double unit membrane surface of schistosomula. for biochemical labeling, parasites were treated with eserine sulfate, which blocked cercarial swimming, secretion, infectivity, and transformation to schistosomula. material labeled by periodate oxidation and nab3h4 was on the surface as shown by autoradiography and had an apparent molecular weight of greater than 10(6) by chromatography. periodate- nab3h4 glycocalyx had an isoelectric point of 5.0 +/- 0.4 and was precipitable with anti-schistosomal antibodies. more than 60% of the radiolabeled glycocalyx was released into the medium by transforming parasites in 3 h and was recovered as high molecular weight material. parasites labeled with periodate and fluorescein-thiosemicarbazide and then transformed had a corona of fluorescence containing microvilli, much of which was shed onto the slide. material on cercariae labeled by lodogen-catalyzed iodination was also of high molecular weight and was antigenic. in conclusion, the cercarial glycocalyx appears to be composed of acidic high molecular weight fibrils which are antigenic and incompletely cleared during transformation.\n",

      "this analysis identified secreted proteins from invasive larvae that are released during invasion of human skin. analysis of specific host proteins in skin invaded by cercariae served to highlight both the histolytic events facilitating cercarial invasion, and the host defenses that attempt to arrest or retard invasion. proteins abundant in psoriatic skin or uv and heat-stressed skin were not abundant in skin invaded by cercariae, suggesting that results did not reflect general stress in the surgically removed skin specimen. abundant immunoglobulins, complement factors, and serine protease inhibitors in skin form a biochemical barrier that complements the structural barrier of the epidermis, basement membrane, and dermis. the fragmentation of some of these host proteins suggests that breaching of host defenses by cercariae includes specific degradation of immunoglobulins and complement, and either degradation of, or overwhelming the host protease inhibitor repertoire.\n",

      "Abstract: background\n",
      "schistosoma japonicum is one of the three major blood fluke species, the etiological agents of schistosomiasis which remains a serious public health problem with an estimated 200 million people infected in 76 countries. in recent years, enormous amounts of both transcriptomic and proteomic data of schistosomes have become available, providing information on gene expression profiles for developmental stages and tissues of s. japonicum. here, we establish a public searchable database, termed sjtpdb, with integrated transcriptomic and proteomic data of s. japonicum, to enable more efficient access and utility of these data and to facilitate the study of schistosome biology, physiology and evolution.\n",
      "description\n",
      "all the available ests, est clusters, and the proteomic dataset of s. japonicum are deposited in sjtpdb. the core of the database is the 8,420 s. japonicum proteins translated from the est clusters, which are well annotated for sequence similarity, structural features, functional ontology, genomic variations and expression patterns across developmental stages and tissues including the tegument and eggshell of this flatworm. the data can be queried by simple text search, blast search, search based on developmental stage of the life cycle, and an integrated search for more specific information. a php-based web interface allows users to browse and query sjtpdb, and moreover to switch to external databases by the following embedded links.\n",

      "Abstract: background\n",
      "individuals living in sub-saharan africa represent 10% of the world's population but almost 2/3 of all hiv-1/aids cases. the disproportionate hiv-1 infection rates in this region may be linked to helminthic parasite infections that affect many individuals in the developing world. however, the hypothesis that parasite infection increases an individual's susceptibility to hiv-1 has never been prospectively tested in a relevant in vivo model.\n",
      "methodology/principal findings\n",
      "we measured whether pre-existing infection of rhesus monkeys with a parasitic worm would facilitate systemic infection after mucosal aids virus exposure. two groups of animals, one consisting of normal monkeys and the other harboring schistosoma mansoni, were challenged intrarectally with decreasing doses of r5-tropic clade c simian-human immunodeficiency virus (shiv-c). systemic infection occurred in parasitized monkeys at viral doses that remained sub-infectious in normal hosts. in fact, the 50% animal infectious (aid50) shiv-c dose was 17-fold lower in parasitized animals compared to controls (p<0.001). coinfected animals also had significantly higher peak viral rna loads than controls (p<0.001), as well as increased viral replication in cd4+ central memory cells (p = 0.03).\n",

      "age profiles of schistosome infection in the study population showed that infection rose to peak in childhood (11–12 years) followed by a sharp decline in infection intensity while prevalence fell more gradually. mean infection intensity was 37 eggs/10 ml urine (se 6.19 eggs/10 ml urine) while infection prevalence was 54.7%. measurements of parasite-specific cytokine responses showed that il-4, il-5 and il-10 but not ifn-γ followed distinct age-profiles. parasite-specific il-10 production developed early, peaking in the youngest age group and declining thereafter; while il-4 and il-5 responses were slower to develop with a later peak. high il-10 producers were likely to be egg positive with il-10 production increasing with increasing infection intensity. furthermore people producing high levels of il-10 produced little or no il-5, suggesting that il-10 may be involved in the regulation of il-5 levels. il-4 and ifn-γ did not show a significant relationship with infection status or intensity and were positively associated with each other.\n",

      "inspection of the nucleotide sequence of bacterial artificial chromosome number 49_j_14 from chromosome 1 of the genome of schistosoma mansoni (genbank ac093105) revealed the likely presence of several rte-like retrotransposons. among these, a new non-ltr retrotransposon designated sr3 was identified and is characterized here. analysis of gene structure and phylogenetic analysis of both the reverse transcriptase and endonuclease domains of the mobile element indicated that sr3 represented a new family of rte-like non-ltr retrotransposons. remarkably, two full-length copies of sr3-like elements were present in bac 49-j-14, and one of 3,211 bp in length appeared to be intact, indicating sr3 to be an active non-ltr retrotransposon. both were flanked by target site duplications of 10–12 bp. southern hybridization and bioinformatics analyses indicated the presence of numerous copies (probably >1,000) of sr3 interspersed throughout the genome of s. mansoni. bioinformatics analyses also revealed sr3 to be transcribed in both larval and adult developmental stages of s. mansoni and to be also present in the genomes of the other major schistosome parasites of humans, schistosoma haematobium and s. japonicum.\n",

      "Abstract: human neutrophils and eosinophils adhere to the surface of schistosomula of schistosoma mansoni that have been preincubated with antischistosomular sera with or without complement. neutrophils are seen to form small (< 0.5 micrometer), heptalaminar and large (5-8 micrometer), pentalaminar fusions with the normal pentalaminar parasite surface membrane. by freeze-fracture techniques, attachment areas 5-8 micrometer in diameter are seen to form between neutrophils and schistosomula. these areas have three zones--an edge and two centrally located areas, one of which is rich and one of which is poor in intramembrane particles (imps). the edge zone is continuous around the attachment areas and is usually composed of a skip-fracture that passes out of the schistosomular outer membrane into the inner membrane. in some cases, the edge zone is made up of a string of imps. the imp-rich central areas have an imp concentration similar to that of unattached neutrophil membranes, are raised off of the surface of the schistosomulum, and have two normal schistosomular membranes underneath indicating that they are indeed unattached. the imp-poor central areas are composed of a fused or hybrid membrane that is continuous with the neutrophil plasma membrane but that bears the same spatial relationship to the schistosomular inner membrane that the normal outer membrane does. similar changes are seen in samples prepared with glycerination. eosinophils generally do not fuse with the schistosomular outer membrane but, instead, discharge their granular contents onto the surface of the schistosomula and appear to adhere to the parasite through this discharged material. it is suggested that schistosomula have a capability to fuse with mammalian cells and that this fusion proceeds from a fusion of the outer leaflets to a fusion of the bilayers, as appears also to be the case in other systems.\n",

      "Abstract: neutrophils and eosinophils adhering to the surface of schistosomula of schistosoma mansoni have been partially or completely detached with hypertonic sucrose or by pipetting. the sucrose-treated neutrophils are attached only in areas where there are pentalaminar fusions between the neutrophil and tegumental membranes, suggesting that these fusions attach the cells to the parasites. pipetting breaks many of the attached cells. in thin section, the tegumental membrane underlying these cells is seen to be pentalaminar. by freeze-fracture techniques, modified attachment areas are found. the edge zone often appears as a single strand of intramembrane particles (imps) on the p2 face and as a groove on the e2 face. the edge zone may also have large discontinuities, in which case it no longer separates membrane faces of unequal imp density from one another. in addition, the imps on the imp- rich areas become aggregated and surrounded by craters in the membrane. these experiments suggest that the fusions may be the mechanism by which the parasite acquires some host membrane components on its surface. on the other hand, eosinophil plasma membranes are seen adhering to a layer of electron-dense material on the parasite after the cells have been disrupted by pipetting. this suggests that eosinophils adhere to the parasite surface through their discharged granule material and not by membrane fusions.\n",

      "Abstract: invertebrates were long thought to possess only a simple, effective and hence non-adaptive defence system against microbial and parasitic attacks. however, recent studies have shown that invertebrate immunity also relies on immune receptors that diversify (e.g. in echinoderms, insects and mollusks (biomphalaria glabrata)). apparently, individual or population-based polymorphism-generating mechanisms exists that permit the survival of invertebrate species exposed to parasites. consequently, the generally accepted arms race hypothesis predicts that molecular diversity and polymorphism also exist in parasites of invertebrates. we investigated the diversity and polymorphism of parasite molecules (schistosoma mansoni polymorphic mucins, smpomucs) that are key factors for the compatibility of schistosomes interacting with their host, the mollusc biomphalaria glabrata. we have elucidated the complex cascade of mechanisms acting both at the genomic level and during expression that confer polymorphism to smpomuc. we show that smpomuc is coded by a multi-gene family whose members frequently recombine. we show that these genes are transcribed in an individual-specific manner, and that for each gene, multiple splice variants exist. finally, we reveal the impact of this polymorphism on the smpomuc glycosylation status. our data support the view that s. mansoni has evolved a complex hierarchical system that efficiently generates a high degree of polymorphism—a “controlled chaos”—based on a relatively low number of genes. this contrasts with protozoan parasites that generate antigenic variation from large sets of genes such as trypanosoma cruzi, trypanosoma brucei and plasmodium falciparum. our data support the view that the interaction between parasites and their invertebrate hosts are far more complex than previously thought. while most studies in this matter have focused on invertebrate host diversification, we clearly show that diversifying mechanisms also exist on the parasite side of the interaction. our findings shed new light on how and why invertebrate immunity develops.contrary to the traditional view that immunity in invertebrates is limited to non-specific mechanisms, recent studies have shown that they have diverse, specific immune receptors. an example is provided by the freps of the mollusk biomphalaria glabrata, polymorphic members of the immunoglobulin superfamily. this capacity for an individual or population-based polymorphic immune response raises the question of whether a corresponding polymorphism exists in parasites of invertebrates, as would be expected in an “arms race” between host and parasite. we have indeed identified such polymorphic molecules in schistosoma mansoni, a flatworm parasite of b. glabrata, by comparing two strains of schistosome that are respectively compatible and incompatible with the same mollusk host strain. however, in contrast to antigenic variation in protozoan parasites that is based on an extensive gene repertoire, we show here that a high level of polymorphism in these s. mansoni polymorphic mucins (smpomucs) is generated from a low number of genes by a complex cascade of mechanisms, a “controlled chaos”.\n",

      "Abstract: in china alone, an estimated 30 million people are at risk of schistosomiasis, caused by the schistosoma japonicum parasite. disease has re-emerged in several regions that had previously attained transmission control, reinforcing the need for active surveillance. the environmental stage of the parasite is known to exhibit high spatial and temporal variability, and current detection techniques rely on a sentinel mouse method which has serious limitations in obtaining data in both time and space. here we describe a real-time pcr assay to quantitatively detect s. japonicum cercariae in laboratory samples and in natural water that has been spiked with known numbers of s. japonicum. multiple primers were designed and assessed, and the best performing set, along with a taqman probe, was used to quantify s. japonicum. the resulting assay was selective, with no amplification detected for schistosoma mansoni, schistosoma haematobium, avian schistosomes nor organisms present in non-endemic surface water samples. repeated samples containing various concentrations of s. japonicum cercariae showed that the real-time pcr method had a strong linear correlation (r2 = 0.921) with light microscopy counts, and the detection limit was below the dna equivalent of half of one cercaria. various cercarial concentrations spiked in 1 liter of natural water followed by a filtration process produced positive detection from 93% of samples analyzed. the real-time pcr method performed well quantifying the relative concentrations of various spiked samples, although the absolute concentration estimates exhibited high variance across replicated samples. overall, the method has the potential to be applied to environmental water samples to produce a rapid, reliable assay for cercarial location in endemic areas.schistosomiasis ranks second only to malaria among parasitic diseases with regard to the number of people infected and those at risk. schistosoma japonicum is the species that causes human and animal disease in china, the philippines, and to a lesser extent, indonesia. recent evidence of schistosomiasis re-emergence in china has reinforced the need for active disease surveillance in these areas. schistosomiasis infection occurs through contact with water contaminated with s. japonicum cercariae, the free-living stage of the parasite shed from intermediate host snails. current practice of detecting cercariae in the environment uses sentinel mice, a method with serious limitations in which mice are exposed to environmental water and then maintained for 6 weeks before being dissected to count worms. the method is labor intensive and costly in terms of time and resources, making it logistically prohibitive to monitor water contact sites regularly or comprehensively. here we develop a quantitative pcr assay to measure s. japonicum cercariae concentration in water, providing a potential method for rapid and reliable data collection in the field, potentially replacing the use of live animal models.\n",

      "the only drug available to treat schistosomiasis is praziquantel. although it is very effective, people regularly get reinfected and need to be retreated once or twice a year. all told, 100 million people are currently being treated with praziquantel. reliance on a single drug, however, is problematic, as the parasites are likely to develop resistance to the drug over time. the identification of new drug targets in schistosomes is therefore an urgent goal. in this study, the researchers have investigated whether thioredoxin glutathione reductase (tgr), a parasitic enzyme with several functions, might be a key target for antischistosomal chemotherapy. they chose this enzyme because adult worms need to make antioxidants (chemicals that prevent oxygen from damaging cells) to protect themselves against the human immune response. antioxidant production in these worms depends on tgr; in mammalian cells, two specialized enzymes do its job. the researchers reasoned, therefore, that tgr might be an essential parasite protein and a potentially important drug target.\n",
      "what did the researchers do and find?\n",
      "the researchers made large quantities of pure tgr and tested its activity against various substrates. the enzymatic properties and substrate preferences of tgr, they found, differed somewhat from those of its mammalian counterparts. they then screened different types of compounds for their ability to inhibit tgr. praziquantel had no effect on tgr activity, but two antischistosomal compounds that are no longer used, potassium antimonyl tartrate and oltipraz, inhibited the enzyme. the most potent inhibitor of tgr, however, was a gold-containing complex called auranofin, low levels of which inhibited tgr in test tubes, completely killed larval, juvenile, and adult parasites living in laboratory dishes within hours, and more than halved the worm burden in infected mice. finally, the researchers used a technique called rna silencing to test the importance of tgr for worm survival. fragments of double-stranded rna (dsrna) stop proteins being made from messenger rna that contains an identical sequence. the addition of tgr dsrna to larval parasites in a dish greatly reduced tgr enzyme activity and killed nearly all the parasites within days.\n",
      "what do these findings mean?\n",
      "these findings suggest tgr as a key target for antischistosomal drug development. indeed, the discovery that two previously used antischistosomal compounds inhibit tgr suggests that the enzyme has already served as a target protein. the rna silencing experiment shows that tgr is essential for parasite survival, and the biochemical analyses indicate that tgr and its mammalian counterparts have different substrate specificities. thus, it should be possible to find compounds that inhibit tgr but have much less effect on the mammalian enzymes. this is certainly true for auranofin, a drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. whether auranofin will be an effective treatment for schistosomiasis remains to be seen—an agent that completely kills schistosomes in animals would be preferable. however, even a 50% reduction in worm burden would decrease the human health problems caused by schistosomiasis, and a combination of auranofin (or another tgr inhibitor) with an agent that works by a different mechanism might be more effective and would also reduce the chances of the parasite developing drug resistance.\n",

      "Abstract: it is suggested that helminths, particularly hookworm and schistosomiasis, may be important causes of anaemia in pregnancy. we assessed the associations between mild-to-moderate anaemia (haemoglobin >8.0 g/dl and <11.2 g/dl) and helminths, malaria and hiv among 2507 otherwise healthy pregnant women at enrolment to a trial of deworming in pregnancy in entebbe, uganda. the prevalence of anaemia was 39.7%. the prevalence of hookworm was 44.5%, mansonella perstans 21.3%, schistosoma mansoni 18.3%, strongyloides 12.3%, trichuris 9.1%, ascaris 2.3%, asymptomatic plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia 10.9% and hiv 11.9%. anaemia showed little association with the presence of any helminth, but showed a strong association with malaria (adjusted odds ratio (aor) 3.22, 95% ci 2.43–4.26) and hiv (aor 2.46, 95% ci 1.90–3.19). there was a weak association between anaemia and increasing hookworm infection intensity. thus, although highly prevalent, helminths showed little association with mild-to-moderate anaemia in this population, but hiv and malaria both showed a strong association. this result may relate to relatively good nutrition and low helminth infection intensity. these findings are pertinent to estimating the disease burden of helminths and other infections in pregnancy.

      "Abstract: background\n",
      "amongst school-aged children living in malaria endemic areas, chronic morbidity and exacerbation of morbidity associated with other infections are often not coincident with the presence or levels of plasmodium parasitaemia, but may result from long-term exposure to the parasite. studies of hepatosplenomegaly associated with schistosoma mansoni infection and exposure to plasmodium infection indicate that differences that occur over 1–2 km in levels of plasmodium transmission are related to the degree of exacerbation of hepatosplenomegaly and that plasmodium falciparum schizont antigen (pfs)-igg3 levels may be a marker for the differing levels of exposure.\n",
      "methods\n",
      "to investigate the validity of pfs-igg3 measurements as a tool to assess these comparative exposure levels on a microgeographical scale, cross-sectional community surveys were conducted over a 10 × 6 km study site in makueni district, kenya, during low and high malaria transmission seasons. during both high and low malaria transmission seasons, thick blood smears were examined microscopically and circulating pfs-igg3 levels measured from dried blood spot elute. gis techniques were used to map prevalence of parasitaemia and pfs-igg3 levels.\n",
      "results\n",
      "microgeographical variations in prevalence of parasitaemia were observed during the high but not the low transmission season. pfs-igg3 levels were stable between high and low transmission seasons, but increased with age throughout childhood before reaching a plateau in adults. adjusting pfs-igg3 levels of school-aged children for age prior to mapping resulted in spatial patterns that reflected the microgeographical variations observed for high season prevalence of parasitaemia, however, pfs-igg3 levels of adults did not. the distances over which age-adjusted pfs-igg3 of school-aged children fluctuated were comparable with those distances over which chronic morbidity has previous been shown to vary.\n",

      "Abstract: background\n",
      "the parasitic trematode schistosoma mansoni is one of the major causative agents of schistosomiasis, a disease that affects approximately 200 million people, mostly in developing countries. since much of the pathology is associated with eggs laid by the female worm, understanding the mechanisms involved in oogenesis and sexual maturation is an important step towards the discovery of new targets for effective drug therapy. it is known that the adult female worm only develops fully in the presence of a male worm and that the rates of oviposition and maturation of eggs are significantly increased by mating. in order to study gene transcripts associated with sexual maturation and oviposition, we compared the gene expression profiles of sexually mature and immature parasites using dna microarrays.\n",
      "results\n",
      "for each experiment, three amplified rna microarray hybridizations and their dye swaps were analyzed. our results show that 265 transcripts are differentially expressed in adult females and 53 in adult males when mature and immature worms are compared. of the genes differentially expressed, 55% are expressed at higher levels in paired females while the remaining 45% are more expressed in unpaired ones and 56.6% are expressed at higher levels in paired male worms while the remaining 43.4% are more expressed in immature parasites. real-time rt-pcr analysis validated the microarray results. several new maturation associated transcripts were identified. genes that were up-regulated in single-sex females were mostly related to energy generation (i.e. carbohydrate and protein metabolism, generation of precursor metabolites and energy, cellular catabolism, and organelle organization and biogenesis) while genes that were down-regulated related to rna metabolism, reactive oxygen species metabolism, electron transport, organelle organization and biogenesis and protein biosynthesis.\n",

      "five species of the genus schistosoma, a parasitic trematode flatworm, are causative agents of schistosomiasis, a disease that is endemic in a large number of developing countries, affecting millions of patients around the world. by using sage (serial analysis of gene expression) we describe here the first large-scale quantitative analysis of the schistosoma mansoni transcriptome, one of the most epidemiologically relevant species of this genus.\n",
      "results\n",
      "after extracting mrna from pooled male and female adult-worms, a sage library was constructed and sequenced, generating 68,238 tags that covered more than 6,000 genes expressed in this developmental stage. an analysis of the ordered tag-list shows the genes of f10 eggshell protein, pol-polyprotein, hsp86, 14-3-3 and a transcript yet to be identified to be the five top most abundant genes in pooled adult worms. whereas only 8% of the 100 most abundant tags found in adult worms of s. mansoni could not be assigned to transcripts of this parasite, 46.9% of the total ditags could not be mapped, demonstrating that the 3 sequence of most of the rarest transcripts are still to be identified. mapping of our sage tags to s. mansoni genes suggested the occurrence of alternative-polyadenylation in at least 13 gene transcripts. most of these events seem to shorten the 3 utr of the mrnas, which may have consequences over their stability and regulation.\n",
      "conclusion\n",
      "sage revealed the frequency of expression of the majority of the s. mansoni genes. transcriptome data suggests that alternative polyadenylation is likely to be used in the control of mrna stability in this organism. when transcriptome was compared with the proteomic data available, we observed a correlation of about 50%, suggesting that both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation are important for determining protein abundance in s. mansoni. the generation of sage tags from other life-cycle stages should contribute to reveal the dynamics of gene expression in this important parasite.\n",

      "methods and findings\n",

      "utilizing a new schistosoma mansoni oligonucleotide dna microarray composed of 37,632 elements, we show that schistosome genomic dna (gdna) hybridizes with less variation compared to complex mixed pools of s. mansoni cdna material (r = 0.993 for gdna compared to r = 0.956 for cdna during ‘self versus self’ hybridizations). furthermore, these effects are species-specific, with s. japonicum or mus musculus gdna failing to bind significantly to s. mansoni oligonucleotide dna microarrays (e.g r = 0.350 when s. mansoni gdna is co-hybridized with s. japonicum gdna). increased median fluorescent intensities (209.9) were also observed for dna microarray elements hybridized with s. mansoni gdna compared to complex mixed pools of s. mansoni cdna (112.2). exploiting these valuable characteristics, s. mansoni gdna was used in two-channel dna microarray hybridization experiments as a common reference for indirect identification of gender-associated transcripts in cercariae, a schistosome life-stage in which there is no overt sexual dimorphism. this led to the identification of 2,648 gender-associated transcripts. when compared to the 780 gender-associated transcripts identified by hybridization experiments utilizing a two-channel direct method (co-hybridization of male and female cercariae cdna), indirect methods using gdna were far superior in identifying greater quantities of differentially expressed transcripts. interestingly, both methods identified a concordant subset of 188 male-associated and 156 female-associated cercarial transcripts, respectively. gene ontology classification of these differentially expressed transcripts revealed a greater diversity of categories in male cercariae. quantitative real-time pcr analysis confirmed the dna microarray results and supported the reliability of this platform for identifying gender-associated transcripts.\n",

      "multiple and dynamic phenotypes could be categorized for schistosomula and adults in vitro, and a diverse set of ‘hit’ drugs and chemistries were identified, including anti-schistosomals, anthelmintics, antibiotics, and neuromodulators. of those hits prioritized for tests in the animal disease model, a number of leads were identified, one of which compares reasonably well with pzq in significantly decreasing worm and egg burdens, and disease-associated pathology. data arising from the three components of the screen are posted online as a community resource.\n",
      "conclusions\n",
      "to accelerate the identification of novel anti-schistosomals, we have developed a partially automated screen workflow that interfaces schistosomula with microtiter plate-formatted compound libraries. the workflow has identified various compounds and drugs as hits in vitro and leads, with the prescribed oral efficacy, in vivo. efforts to improve throughput, automation, and rigor of the screening workflow are ongoing.\n",

      "Abstract: schistosoma mansoni schistosomula recovered from the lungs of mice have previously been shown to express host-derived class i and class ii major histocompatibility complex (mhc) antigens. to investigate the tissue origin of parasite-acquired mhc products, lung-stage schistosomula were obtained from a series of parent leads to f1 and f1 leads to parent bone marrow chimeras and the parasites typed by immunofluorescence for the presence of haplotype-specific k region and i region mhc determinants. the results of these experiments indicated that, despite their intravascular residence in the host, schistosomula derive all of their class i antigen from a nonhemapoietic tissue source. in contrast, the class ii antigens expressed on the surface of schistosomula were found to originate from bone marrow-derived donor cells. these results support the hypothesis that mhc product acquisition by schistosomes involves selective and specific interactions with host tissue and, in the case of class i antigens, suggest that the endothelium may be a major site of host molecule uptake for the parasite.\n",

      "Abstract: schistosomiasis, due to schistosoma mansoni, is a major health problem in many subtropical countries, and major efforts are being made to define a vaccine. in this regard, we have reported that sera from subjects with low susceptibility to infection by s. mansoni react with a major larval surface antigen (p-37), having an apparent molecular mass of 37 kd, against which sera of susceptible individuals show little reactivity. we have now cloned the cdna for this antigen by screening a schistosome cdna expression library with antibodies against the purified protein. the selected cdnas encode a protein that is specifically identified by immune human sera containing antibodies against p-37, while sera exhibiting low or no reactivity toward p-37 fail to recognize the recombinant protein. the cloned cdnas hybridize with a 1.2-kb rna that is the transcript of a single copy gene. this rna directs the synthesis of a 36.5-kd polypeptide that is precipitated by sera from the most resistant subjects. the amino acid sequence of the encoded polypeptide shows homology with the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3p-dehydrogenase (72.5% of positional identity with human glyceraldehyde-3p-dehydrogenase). antibodies against the recombinant protein identified p-37 on the larva. these findings, together with other reports, indicate that a number of conserved proteins may be major targets of host-protective immunity against s. mansoni. the hypothesis is discussed that genetic restriction of the immune response to these antigens may occur in heterogeneous human populations because of the limited number of t cell epitopes carried by these host-like proteins. such genetic effects might allow parasite transmission through nonresponder (susceptible) individuals. this hypothesis and the protective properties of p-37 can now be tested using the recombinant protein and synthetic peptides derived from selected regions of the polypeptide chain.\n",

      "Abstract: mice were exposed to different intensities of infection with schistosoma mansoni (10, 50, or 200 cercariae) and the kinetics of peripheral and bone marrow eosinophilia was followed for as long as 20 wk. when the schistosomula (immature worms) were migrating from the lungs to the liver there was a mild, transient eosinophilia, but soon after the onset of egg laying by the schistosomes, a major and prolonged increase in eosinophils occurred. this was terminated in the heavier infections by the death of the animals, but showed a spontaneous decline beginning at 18 wk in the lightly infected mice. the effect of s. mansoni eggs on eosinophilia in the blood, bone marrow, and granulomatous lesions was then examined by injecting schistosome eggs into mice intraperitoneally, subcutaneously, and intravenously. while the host response was dependent on the route by which eggs were administered, primary peripheral and bone marrow responses were seen on intravenous injection, and secondary responses occurred on intravenous and subcutaneous injection. in unsensitized and egg-sensitized mice, eosinophils were first seen around eggs injected into the pulmonary microvasculature at 96 and 24 h respectively. when the granulomas were maximal in size eosinophils made up at least 50% of the lesions. administration of antieosinophil serum profoundly suppressed eosinophils in the peripheral blood, eliminated mature eosinophils and markedly increased eosinophil precursors in the bone marrow, and ablated eosinophils from the tissue lesions, considerably reducing their area.\n",

      "Abstract: previous studies have shown that eosinophils from eosinophilic individuals differ functionally from those of normal individuals. in order to test whether agents that might induce eosinophilia could also affect eosinophil function, we have compared the capacity of culture supernatants from mononuclear cells of eosinophilic or normal individuals to enhance eosinophil activity, as reflected by an increased killing of schistosomula of schistosoma mansoni in vitro. an enhancing activity was detected, which increased both the antibody- dependent, and to some extent the antibody-independent killing of schistosomula by eosinophils, in the absence of complement. under similar conditions, the supernatants failed to stimulate an otherwise undetectable neutrophil-mediated killing. the activity could be removed from the assay by washing, without reversing previous eosinophil stimulation, and was not directly toxic to the schistosomula. preliminary characterization of the activity indicated that it was relatively heat-stable at 100 degrees c for 30 min, and had an estimated molecular weight of 35,000-45,000 as judged by g-200 sephadex fractionation. the activity was produced by a nonlymphocytic, nonspecific esterase-containing adherent mononuclear cell in the absence of either con a or antigenic stimulation. significant enhancing activity was detectable after 1 h of culture and continued for at least 25 h. protein synthesis was required for its production or release. although the activity was detectable in supernatants from both eosinophilic and normal individuals, the supernatants that demonstrated highest activity and that could be titrated out furthest were generally derived from eosinophilic individuals, suggesting that there might be some association between eosinophilia and enhanced eosinophil function.\n",

      "Abstract: nonspecific resistance to the multicellular organism schistosoma mansoni can be induced in mice by several infectious agents. we utilized the observed genetic restriction of such acquired resistance to study the mediators of killing of the larval stage of s. mansoni in vitro. adherent peritoneal cell monolayers from corynebacterium parvum-treated c57bl/6j but not from c. parvum-treated balb/cj mice killed an increased proportion of schistosomula in 24 h. activated macrophages (mφ) from both strains exhibited enhanced h(2)0(2) production after incubation with the parasites or phorbol myristate acetate. thus h(2)0(2) production was not associated with schistosomula killing. moreover, schistosomula killing was unaffected by catalase or superoxide dismutase. in contrast, activated c57bl/6j (but not balb/cj) mφ released fourfold more arginase into supernates than control mφ. schistosomula killing by these mφ correlated with arginase content of the supernates, was exaggerated in arginine-poor medium, and could be blocked by the addition of arginine. exogenous bovine arginase added to fischer's medium without macrophages produced comparable parasite mortality. our data suggest that arginase is a critical mediator of in vitro killing of this multicellular organism by activated macrophages.\n",

      "Abstract: macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (mip-1 alpha) is a 6-8-kd, lipopolysaccharide-inducible monocyte and neutrophil chemotactic protein that may be important in acute and chronic inflammation. the present study determined the sequential production, source, and in vivo contribution of murine mip-1 alpha in synchronized schistosoma mansoni egg pulmonary granuloma formation. granulomas were examined under conditions of primary, secondary vigorous, and secondary immunomodulated immunity. secreted mip-1 alpha was measured in 24-h supernatants from intact granulomas (700/ml) cultured with or without soluble egg antigen (sea). primary granulomas isolated from naive mice over a 16-d period showed low spontaneous mip-1 alpha production (< 1 ng/ml). however, when primary granulomas were challenged with sea, significant mip-1 alpha production was observed beginning at day 4 and peaking at day 16. intact vigorous (isolated from 8-wk-infected mice) and modulated (isolated from 20-wk-infected mice) secondary pulmonary granulomas demonstrated comparable spontaneous mip-1 alpha production. addition of sea to vigorous stage granulomas augmented expression of mip-1 alpha at all time points, whereas stimulated modulated stage granulomas did not increase production. the latter observation is likely related to endogenous immunoregulatory mechanisms reported for modulated stage animals. immunohistochemical localization of mip-1 alpha in granuloma sections and cytocentrifuge preparations from vigorous lesions localized mip-1 alpha production to macrophages within granulomas. treatment of mice with rabbit anti-mouse mip-1 alpha antibodies significantly decreased 8-d primary granuloma formation (> 40%) when compared with control mice. anti-mip-1 alpha sera also decreased vigorous (> 20%), but not modulated granuloma formation. these findings demonstrate that mip-1 alpha contributes to cellular recruitment during schistosome egg granuloma formation.\n",

      "Abstract: previous work (1)(1) has shown that normal human eosinophils show a preferential capacity, in comparison with neutrophils, to bind to antibody- coated schistosomula of schistosoma mansoni. this effect is attributable to a temperature-dependent function of the eosinophil which renders its binding stable and irreversible by aggregated gamma globulin or staphylococcus aureus protein a. in contrast, the binding of neutrophils is readily reversible by these agents. it has now been shown that the differences observed between eosinophils and neutrophils is a property of their interaction with living schistosomula. when dead or artificially damaged schistosomula were tested, neutrophils showed a markedly enhanced capacity to adhere, in both the presence and absence of anti-chistosomular serum. subsequent experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that the strong, stable binding of eosinophils was attributable to degranulation, with release of granule contents which would then serve as ligands to bind the cell to the organism. first, an enhanced adherence both of eosinophils and of neutrophils could be demonstrated in the presence of eosinophil major basic protein (mbp) or of protamine, a high molecular weight cation. second, the binding of eosinophils induced by concanavalin a (con a) was found to differ markedly from that induced by antischistosomular serum. con a-mediated binding of eosinophils was fully reversible by alpha-methyl-mannoside, was not associated with damage to the organism, and did not lead to degranulation of the cell, as estimated by measuring the release of mbp into the culture supernate. however, induction of degranulation of concanavalin a-bound eosinophils, but not of neutrophils, with the calcium ionophore a23187 converted the reaction into one which was no longer reversible by alpha- methylmannoside and in which damage to the organism now did occur. these findings support the hypothesis that the stable binding of eosinophils is associated with degranulation, a process which may contribute to the preferential capacity of this cell to mediate antibody-dependent damage to schistosomula.\n",

      "Abstract: a method was developed for coupling a hapten, trinitrophenyl (tnp), to the surface of schistosomula of schistosoma mansoni which results in a minimal loss in their viability as judged by morphological examination in vitro and survival after injection in vivo. skin-stage (3-h-old) and lung-stage (5-d-old) schistosomula surface labeled in this manner were then compared for their susceptibility to killing by anti-tnp antibody- dependent effector mechanisms both in vivo and in vitro. tnp skin-stage larvae were readily rejected in mice actively immunized against tnp bovine gamma globulin and were highly susceptible to anti-tnp-dependent killing mediated either by complement or purified human eosinophils in vitro. in contrast, tnp-lung-stage schistosomula, which were shown by microfluorimetry to bind anti-tnp antibody to approximately the same extent as skin-stage schistosomula, were found to be resistant to killing by the same in vivo and in vitro mechanisms. these findings suggest that the insusceptibility of postskin-stage schistosomula to antibody-dependent killing must result at least in part from an intrinsic structural change in the integument of the parasite and cannot be caused solely by the masking of parasite antigens by acquired host molecules, a mechanism of immune evasion previously proposed for schistosomes.\n",

      "Abstract: partial immunity to schistosomiasis mansoni has been demonstrated in mice and has recently been transferred passively with serum, but not with cells. in vitro studies using human and rodent materials have demonstrated antibody-dependent cell-mediated damage to immature schistosomes (schistosomula); the cell involved in some of these in vitro systems appears to be the neutrophil and in others the eosinophil is suspected. in the present study the effect of antileukocyte sera on partial immunity to schistosomiasis was tested in vivo using quantitative assay systems for schistosomula in the lungs and adult worms in the portal venous system. mice infected with 10 cercariae of schistosoma mansoni 16 and 32 wk before challenge with 500 cercariae showed reductions in the recovery of schistosomula at 4 and 6 days of approximately 40%; adult worm recovery was reduced by 60%. treatment with antilymphocyte, antimacrophage, or antineutrophil serum had no effect on the numbers of schistosomula recovered from the lungs of immune animals, but in the mice treated with antieosinophil serum the numbers of schistosomula and adult worms recovered increased to the levels seen in normal nonimmune animals. furthermore, sera collected from the partially immune mice and passively transferred to uninfected mice conferred a marked resistance to infection as measured by recovery of schistosomula; this was also abrogated by treatment with antieosinophil serum. these studies suggest that antibody-dependent cell-mediated immunity to schistosomiasis occurs in vivo, and also establishes a role for the eosinophil in immune systems.\n",

      "Abstract: factors stimulating eosinophil differentiation in vitro have been studied by means of a liquid bone marrow culture system in which the number of eosinophils is estimated directly by morphology or indirectly by assay for eosinophil peroxidase. the results show that eosinophil colonies are not formed in agar, emphasizing the importance of the liquid culture system. three types of evidence identify a novel lymphokine, eosinophil-differentiating factor (edf). (a) coordinate analysis of lymphokine activity in media conditioned by a panel of parasite antigen and another panel of alloantigen-reactive t cell clones indicates that edf is distinct from interleukin 2 (il-2), il-3, and bone marrow proliferation activity (bmpa). (b) a t hybrid (nimp- th1) produces edf but no il-2, il-3, interferon, or colony-stimulating factor. (c) gel filtration of conditioned media (cm) indicates that nimp-th1 and a t clone (nimp-t2) produce edf (mr 46,000). nimp-t2 also produced il-3 (mr 26,000) but this was easily separated from edf. il-3 is also shown to have eosinophil differentiation activity (eda) but this represents a very small proportion of the eda in t2-cm. fractionation of wehi-3-cm indicates that eda from this source has a similar elution profile to il-3 (mr 35-36,000). furthermore, a comparison of the relative activities in purified il-3 and wehi-3-cm indicates that all the eda can be attributed to the il-3 in the latter. edf is shown to stimulate production of eosinophils in long-term bone marrow cultures; the kinetics of eosinophil production suggests that edf is acting on committed precursors in the bone marrow. the transient nature of eosinophil production suggests that precursors from multipotential stem cells are not produced. the eosinophils produced in these cultures are morphologically normal and functional in that they lysed sheep red blood cells coated with igg1, igg2a, and igg2b, but not with igm, iga, or ige. in addition, they were capable of adhering to and killing schistosoma mansoni schistosomula.\n",

      "Abstract: background\n",
      "many parasites of medical and veterinary importance are transmitted by cold-blooded intermediate hosts or vectors, the abundance of which will vary with ambient temperatures, potentially altering disease prevalence. in particular, if global climate change will increase mean ambient temperature in a region endemic with a human pathogen then it is possible that the incidence of disease will similarly increase. here we examine this possibility by using a mathematical model to explore the effects of increasing long-term mean ambient temperature on the prevalence and abundance of the parasite schistosoma mansoni, the causative agent of schistosomiasis in humans.\n",
      "principal findings\n",
      "the model showed that the impact of temperature on disease prevalence and abundance is not straightforward; the mean infection burden in humans increases up to 30°c, but then crashes at 35°c, primarily due to increased mortalities of the snail intermediate host. in addition, increased temperatures changed the dynamics of disease from stable, endemic infection to unstable, epidemic cycles at 35°c. however, the prevalence of infection was largely unchanged by increasing temperatures. temperature increases also affected the response of the model to changes in each parameter, indicating certain control strategies may become less effective with local temperature changes. at lower temperatures, the most effective single control strategy is to target the adult parasites through chemotherapy. however, as temperatures increase, targeting the snail intermediate hosts, for example through molluscicide use, becomes more effective.\n",
      "conclusions\n",
      "these results show that s. mansoni will not respond to increased temperatures in a linear fashion, and the optimal control strategy is likely to change as temperatures change. it is only through a mechanistic approach, incorporating the combined effects of temperature on all stages of the life-cycle, that we can begin to predict the consequences of climate change on the incidence and severity of such diseases.\n",

      "somatostatin administration showed little toxicity, probably due to its short half-life. total liver and spleen weights of s. mansoni infected animals increased over time, with no changes observed due to somatostatin therapy. total body weights were decreased after infection but were not affected by somatostatin therapy. snap frozen liver sections were stained with haematoxylin-eosin or masson's trichrome to study parasite count, hepatocyte status, granuloma size and cellularity. after somatostatin treatment mean egg counts per liver section (43.76 ± 3.56) were significantly reduced as compared to the egg counts in untreated mice after 10 weeks of infection (56.01 ± 3.34) (p = 0.03). similar significant reduction in parasite egg counts were also observed after somatostatin treatment at 14 weeks of infection (56.62 ± 3.02) as compared to untreated animals (69.82 ± 2.77)(p = 0.006). fibrosis was assessed from the spectrophotometric determination of tissue hydroxyproline. infection with s. mansoni caused increased hydroxyproline levels (9.37 ± 0.63 μmol at wk10; 9.65 ± 0.96 μmol at wk14) as compared to uninfected animals (1.06 ± 0.10 μmol). this significant increase in collagen content (p = 0.01; 0.007 respectively) marks the fibrosis observed at these time points. treatment with somatostatin resulted in a significant decrease in hydroxyproline levels both at wk10 (4.76 ± 0.58 μmol) and at wk14 (5.8 ± 1.13 μmol) (p = 0.01; 0.03 respectively). endogenous somatostatin levels were increased at wk10 (297 ± 37.24 pg/ml) and wk14 (206 ± 13.30 pg/ml) of infection as compared to uninfected mice (119 ± 11.99 pg/ml) (p = 0.01; 0.008 respectively). circulating somatostatin levels in infected animals were not significantly affected by somatostatin treatment. hepatocyte status remained unaltered and granulomas were not remarkably changed in size or cellularity.\n",

      "Abstract: members of transforming growth factor-beta (tgf-β) superfamily play pivotal roles in development in multicellular organisms. we report the functional characterization of the schistosoma mansoni type ii receptor (smtβrii). mining of the s. mansoni expressed sequence tag (est) database identified an est clone that shows homology to the kinase domain of type ii receptors from different species. the amplified est sequence was used as a probe to isolate a cdna clone spanning the entire coding region of a type ii serine/threonine kinase receptor. the interaction of smtβrii with smtβri was elucidated and shown to be dependent on tgf-β ligand binding. furthermore, in the presence of human tgf-β1, smtβrii was able to activate smtβri, which in turn activated smsmad2 and promoted its interaction with smsmad4, proving the transfer of the signal from the receptor complex to the smad proteins. gynaecophoral canal protein (gcp), whose expression in male worms is limited to the gynaecophoric canal, was identified as a potential tgf-β target gene in schistosomes. knocking down the expression of smtβrii using short interfering rna molecules (sirna) resulted in a concomitant reduction in the expression of gcp. these data provide evidence for the direct involvement of smtβrii in mediating tgf-β–induced activation of the tgf-β target gene, smgcp, within schistosome parasites. the results also provide additional evidence for a role for the tgf-β signaling pathway in male-induced female reproductive development.schistosomes are multicellular parasites that infect 200 million people worldwide. schistosome development in the human host likely involves host molecules that regulate biological processes of the parasite. members of transforming growth factor-beta (tgf-β) superfamily play pivotal roles in development in multicellular organisms. tgf-β signaling requires ligand binding to a specific surface receptor, tgf-β type ii receptor. the authors isolated the schistosome tgf-β type ii receptor (smtβrii), which was found to be biologically active and responded to stimulation by host tgf-β. the gynaecophoric canal is a ventral groove in the male worm in which the female must reside for sexual maturity. gynaecophoral canal protein (gcp) is a protein whose expression in male worms is limited to the gynaecophoric canal and is implicated in female reproductive maturation. gcp expression was found to be regulated by human tgf-β. knocking down the expression of smtβrii resulted in a concomitant reduction in the expression of gcp, providing evidence for the direct involvement of smtβrii-mediated, host tgf-β–induced regulation of schistosome gene expression. this study implicates the tgf-β signaling pathway in worm pairing, a prerequisite for female egg production. because the eggs produced by the worm pairs are responsible for pathogenesis, the authors' research identifies potential targets for intervention.\n",

      "Abstract: background\n",
      "bilharzia is one of the major parasitic infections affecting the public health and socioeconomic circumstances in (sub) tropical areas. its causative agents are schistosomes. since these worms remain in their host for decades, they have developed mechanisms to evade or resist the immune system. like several other parasites, their surface membranes are coated with a protective layer of glycoproteins that are anchored by a lipid modification.\n",
      "methods and findings\n",
      "we studied the release of glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (gpi)-anchored proteins of s. mansoni and found them in the circulation associated with host lipoprotein particles. host cells endocytosed schistosomal gpi-anchored proteins via their lipoprotein receptor pathway, resulting in disturbed lysosome morphology. in patients suffering from chronic schistosomiasis, antibodies attacked the parasite gpi-anchored glycoproteins that were associated with the patients' own lipoprotein particles. these immunocomplexes were endocytosed by cells carrying an immunoglobulin-fc receptor, leading to clearance of lipoproteins by the immune system. as a consequence, neutral lipids accumulated in neutrophils of infected hamsters and in human neutrophils incubated with patient serum, and this accumulation was associated with apoptosis and reduced neutrophil viability. also, trypanosoma brucei, the parasite that causes sleeping sickness, released its major gpi-anchored glycoprotein vsg221 on lipoprotein particles, demonstrating that this process is generalizable to other pathogens/parasites.\n",
      "conclusions\n",
      "transfer of parasite antigens to host cells via host lipoproteins disrupts lipid homeostasis in immune cells, promotes neutrophil apoptosis, may result in aberrant antigen presentation in host cells, and thus cause an inefficient immune response against the pathogen.\n",

      "more than 200 million people live in a close but uneasy alliance with schistosomes, a type of parasitic worm. like many parasites, schistosomes have a complicated life cycle. they start life by reproducing in fresh-water snails. the snails release free-swimming, infectious parasites, which burrow into the skin of people who swim in the water. the parasites then migrate to the veins draining the gut and mature into 10–20 mm-long adult worms. the worms mate and lay eggs, some of which pass into the feces and so back into water where they hatch and infect fresh snails. schistosomiasis does not kill many people but it does cause serious health problems. most of these are caused by the human immune system responding to eggs that get trapped in the veins of the liver, spleen, and gut. immune cells recognize proteins on the eggs as foreign and organize a hard shell of immune cells and tough fibres around the egg. eventually, these fibres block the blood vessels in the liver, spleen, and gut, causing locally raised blood pressure, organ damage, and potentially fatal bleeding. although the immune system mounts a vigorous attack against schistosome eggs, the parasites themselves somehow evade the immune response—adult worms pull off this feat of “invisibility” for years. the researchers who did this study wanted to find out whether the release of glycoproteins (proteins decorated with sugars) from the surface of the schistosome worms is involved in this immune evasion in some way. these glycoproteins (which are anchored to the parasite's surface by a structure called a gpi-anchor; gpi stands for glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol, a sort of fat or lipid) are the major antigens of schistosomes—the molecules that the immune system normally recognizes on foreign intruders.the researchers first showed that gpi-anchored schistosomal glycoproteins are released into the circulation of patients and there become attached to human lip oproteinparticles (water-soluble carrier molecules that take fats around the body). then, using cells grown in the laboratory, the researchers discovered that lipoprotein particles loaded with parasite glycoproteins could enter mammalian cells through an interaction with a protein called the low-density lipoprotein receptor, which normally helps cells absorb the lipids needed to make membranes. once in the cell, the parasite glycoproteins travelled to cellular regions called lysosomes, which they seemed to disrupt. in addition, the researchers found that the parasite glycoproteins could enter mammalian cells by a second route: this involved the glycoproteins being taken up by neutrophils (a type of immune cells). many of these neutrophils then died, possibly because of the large amount of lipid they accumulated.these results provide some tantalising clues to how schistosomes might evade the immune response. first, just binding to lipoprotein particles might change how they are seen by the immune system (possible they are not as clearly recognized as foreign substances) and weaken the immune response against them. on the other hand, the damage done to neutrophils by lipid accumulation might also contribute to how schistosomes hide in the human hosts. neutrophils are an important type of immune cell, and their destruction could compromise the immune system's response to schistosomes. furthermore, although the researchers do not investigate this possibility, other cells of the immune system that have might also take up these lipids and be damaged. finally, even if immune cells are not killed outright by lipid accumulation, disruption of their lysosomes might also affect how well the immune system recognizes schistosomes as foreign. the full details of the complex interplay between schistosomes and their hosts remain a mystery, but these results provide intriguing new avenues to explore that might eventually suggest new treatments for schistosomiasis.please access these websites via the online version of this summary at http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0030253. • world health organization information on schistosomiasis• us centers for disease control and prevention information for the public and for professionals on schistosomiasis• medlineplus encyclopedia entry on schistosomiasis• wikipedia page on schistosomiasis (note: wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit)\n",

      "Abstract: background\n",
      "the function of voltage-gated calcium (cav) channels greatly depends on coupling to cytoplasmic accessory β subunits, which not only promote surface expression, but also modulate gating and kinetic properties of the α1 subunit. schistosomes, parasitic platyhelminths that cause schistosomiasis, express two β subunit subtypes: a structurally conventional β subunit and a variant β subunit with unusual functional properties. we have previously characterized the functional properties of the variant cavβ subunit. here, we focus on the modulatory phenotype of the conventional cavβ subunit (smcavβ) using the human cav2.3 channel as the substrate for smcavβ and the whole-cell patch-clamp technique.\n",
      "results\n",
      "the conventional schistosoma mansoni cavβ subunit markedly increases cav2.3 currents, slows macroscopic inactivation and shifts steady state inactivation in the hyperpolarizing direction. however, currents produced by cav2.3 in the presence of smcavβ run-down to approximately 75% of their initial amplitudes within two minutes of establishing the whole-cell configuration. this suppressive effect was independent of ca2+, but dependent on intracellular mg2+-atp. additional experiments revealed that smcavβ lends the cav2.3/smcavβ complex sensitivity to na+ ions. a mutant version of the cavβ subunit lacking the first forty-six amino acids, including a string of twenty-two acidic residues, no longer conferred sensitivity to intracellular mg2+-atp and na+ ions, while continuing to show wild type modulation of current amplitude and inactivation of cav2.3.\n",

      "over a 2-year period, using a molecular epidemiological approach, we examined spatial and temporal distributions, and the overlap of these schistosomes within snails, in natural settings in kenya. both species had spatially and temporally patchy distributions, although s. mansoni was eight times more common than s. rodhaini. both species were overdispersed within snails, and most snails (85.2% for s. mansoni and 91.7% for s. rodhaini) only harbored one schistosome genotype. over time, half of snails infected with multiple genotypes showed a replacement pattern in which an initially dominant genotype was less represented in later replicates. the other half showed a consistent pattern over time; however, the ratio of each genotype was skewed. profiles of circadian emergence of cercariae revealed that s. rodhaini emerges throughout the 24-hour cycle, with peak emergence before sunrise and sometimes immediately after sunset, which differs from previous reports of a single nocturnal peak immediately after sunset. peak emergence for s. mansoni cercariae occurred as light became most intense and overlapped temporally with s. rodhaini. comparison of schistosome communities within snails against a null model indicated that the community was structured and that coinfections were more common than expected by chance. in mixed infections, cercarial emergence over 24 hours remained similar to single species infections, again with s. rodhaini and s. mansoni cercarial emergence profiles overlapping substantially.\n",

      "Abstract: schistosomes are parasitic worms that infect hundreds of millions of people in developing countries. they cause disease by virtue of the fact that the eggs that they produce, which are intended for release from the host in order to allow transmission of infection, can become trapped in target organs such as the liver, where they induce damaging inflammation. egg production by female schistosomes is critically dependent on the presence of male parasites, without which females never fully develop, and (counterintuitively) on the contribution of signals from the host's immune system. very little is understood about the molecular basis of these interactions. here, we describe a newly discovered schistosome gene, which is expressed in the reproductive tract of the female parasite and in parasite eggs. the protein encoded by this gene is made only when females are paired with males in an immunologically competent setting. using recently developed tools that allow gene function to be inhibited in schistosomes, we show that the product of this gene plays a crucial role in egg development. examining how the expression of this gene is controlled has the potential to provide insight into the molecular nature of the interactions between male and female parasites and their hosts. moreover, the pivotal role of this gene in the egg makes it a potential target for blocking transmission and disease development.\n",

      "Abstract: infectious cercariae of schistosoma mansoni gain entry to the mammalian host through the skin where they induce a transient inflammatory influx of mononuclear cells. some of these cells have antigen-presenting cell function (mhcii+) and have been reported to migrate to the skin-draining lymph nodes (sdln) where they have the potential to prime cd4+ cells of the acquired immune response. here, in mice exposed to vaccinating radiation-attenuated schistosome larvae, which induce high levels of protective immunity to challenge infection, we describe the parasite-induced migration of langerhans cells (lcs) from the epidermal site of immunisation to the sdln using a specific monoclonal antibody that recognises langerin (cd207). cd207+ cells with dendritic morphology were abundant in the epidermis at all times and their migration into the dermis was detected soon after vaccination. all cd207+ lcs were mhcii+ but not all mhcii+ cells in the skin were cd207+. lcs migrated from the dermis in enhanced numbers after vaccination, as detected in dermal exudate populations recovered after in vitro culture of skin biopsies. elevated numbers of cd207+ lcs were also detected in the sdln from 24 h to 4 days after vaccination. however, compared with other dermal-derived antigen-presenting cells that were cd207−mhcii+ or cd207−cd11c+, the relative numbers of cd207+ cells in the dermal exudate population and in the sdln were very small. furthermore, the migration of cd207+ cells after exposure to ‘protective’ radiation-attenuated, compared with ‘non-protective’ normal cercariae, was similar in terms of numbers and kinetics. together, these studies suggest that cd207+ lcs are only a minor component of the antigen-presenting cell population that migrates from the epidermis and they are unlikely to be important in the priming of protective cd4+ cells in the sdln.\n",

      "nuclear receptors (nrs) are important transcriptional modulators in metazoans which regulate transcription through binding to the promoter region of their target gene by the dna binding domain (dbd) and activation or repression of mrna synthesis through co-regulators bound to the ligand binding domain (lbd). nrs typically have a single dbd with a lbd.\n",
      "results\n",
      "three nuclear receptors named 2dbd-nrs, were identified from the flatworm schistosoma mansoni that each possess a novel set of two dbds in tandem with a lbd. they represent a novel nr modular structure: a/b-dbd-dbd-hinge-lbd. the 2dbd-nrs form a new subfamily of nrs, vii. by database mining, 2dbd-nr genes from other flatworm species (schmidtea mediterranea and dugesia japonica), from mollusks (lottia gigantean) and from arthropods (daphnia pulex) were also identified. all 2dbd-nrs possess a p-box sequence of ceackk in the first dbd, which is unique to 2dbd-nrs, and a p-box sequence of cegckg in the second dbd. phylogenetic analyses of both dbd and ligand binding domain sequences showed that 2dbd-nr genes originate from a common two dbd-containing ancestor gene. a single 2dbd-nr orthologue was found in arthropoda, platyhelminths and mollusca. subsequent 2dbd-nr gene evolution in mollusks and platyhelminths involved gene duplication. chromosome localization of s. mansoni 2dbd-nr genes by fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) suggests that 2dbd-nr genes duplicated on different chromosomes in the platyhelminths. dimerization of sm2dbdα indicates that 2dbd-nrs may act as homodimers, suggesting either that two repeats of a half-site are necessary for each dbd of 2dbd-nrs to bind to its target gene, or that each 2dbd-nr can recognize multiple sites.\n",

      "in this cohort, polymorphisms in il-4 (−590t high ige), il-13 (−1055t high producer) and ifn-γ (+874a high producer) demonstrated several correlations with resistance to reinfection. resistance to reinfection was significantly correlated with the heterozygous il-4 −590 genotype c/t (or 3.5, [ci 1.2, 10.2]) compared to t/t. among men with a homozygous il-13 genotype cc/tt, having a t allele at the ifn-γ +874 position increased the odds of resistance relative to individuals with the ifn-γ +874 a/a genotype (or = 17.5 [ci 3.0, 101.5]). among men with homozygous a/a ifn-γ genotype, the heterozygous il-13 genotype c/t was associated with resistance relative to the homozygous c/c or t/t genotypes (or = 22.5 [ci 3.5, 144.4]). no increases in odds of resistance were found in relation to the il-13 genotype among those with a t allele in the ifn-γ gene or in relation to the ifn-γ genotype among those with a heterozygous il-13 genotype. calculation of the attributable proportion of resistance showed a significant synergistic interaction between il-13 −1055 c/t and il-4 −590 c/t.\n",
      "conclusions\n",
      "the identified polymorphisms do not by themselves confer resistance or susceptibility, but we propose that these genotypes allow the resistant phenotype to be developed and expressed upon suitable immune exposure. based on the literature, these polymorphisms contribute to the regulation of their respective cytokines, likely leading to downstream differences in the production and interrelationships of critical defense mechanisms.\n",

      "Abstract: background\n",
      "biomphalaria glabrata is an intermediate snail host for schistosoma mansoni, one of the important schistosomes infecting man. b. glabrata/s. mansoni provides a useful model system for investigating the intimate interactions between host and parasite. examining differential gene expression between s. mansoni-exposed schistosome-resistant and susceptible snail lines will identify genes and pathways that may be involved in snail defences.\n",
      "results\n",
      "we have developed a 2053 element cdna microarray for b. glabrata containing clones from orestes (open reading frame ests) libraries, suppression subtractive hybridization (ssh) libraries and clones identified in previous expression studies. snail haemocyte rna, extracted from parasite-challenged resistant and susceptible snails, 2 to 24 h post-exposure to s. mansoni, was hybridized to the custom made cdna microarray and 98 differentially expressed genes or gene clusters were identified, 94 resistant-associated and 4 susceptible-associated. quantitative pcr analysis verified the cdna microarray results for representative transcripts. differentially expressed genes were annotated and clustered using gene ontology (go) terminology and kyoto encyclopaedia of genes and genomes (kegg) pathway analysis. 61% of the identified differentially expressed genes have no known function including the 4 susceptible strain-specific transcripts. resistant strain-specific expression of genes implicated in innate immunity of invertebrates was identified, including hydrolytic enzymes such as cathepsin l, a cysteine proteinase involved in lysis of phagocytosed particles; metabolic enzymes such as ornithine decarboxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the production of polyamines, important in inflammation and infection processes, as well as scavenging damaging free radicals produced during production of reactive oxygen species; stress response genes such as hsp70; proteins involved in signalling, such as importin 7 and copine 1, cytoplasmic intermediate filament (if) protein and transcription enzymes such as elongation factor 1α and ef-2.\n",

      "orthologs of the vertebrate atp gated p2x channels have been identified in dictyostelium and green algae, demonstrating that the emergence of ionotropic purinergic signalling was an early event in eukaryotic evolution. however, the genomes of a number of animals including drosophila melanogaster and caenorhabditis elegans, both members of the ecdysozoa superphylum, lack p2x-like proteins, whilst other species such as the flatworm schistosoma mansoni have p2x proteins making it unclear as to what stages in evolution p2x receptors were lost. here we describe the functional characterisation of a p2x receptor (hdp2x) from the tardigrade hypsibius dujardini demonstrating that purinergic signalling is preserved in some ecdysozoa.\n",

      "conclusion\n",
      "the presence of a p2x receptor in a tardigrade species suggests that both nematodes and arthropods lost their p2x genes independently, as both traditional and molecular phylogenies place the divergence between nematoda and arthropoda before their divergence from tardigrada. the phylogenetic analysis performed in our study also clearly demonstrates that the emergence of the family of seven p2x channels in human and other mammalian species was a relatively recent evolutionary event that occurred subsequent to the split between vertebrates and invertebrates. furthermore, several characteristics of hdp2x including fast kinetics with low atp sensitivity, potentiation by ivermectin in a channel with fast kinetics and distinct copper and zinc binding sites not dependent on histidines make hdp2x a useful model for comparative structure-function studies allowing a better understanding of p2x receptors in higher organisms.\n",

      "Abstract: decay-accelerating factor (daf) is a 70-kd membrane glycoprotein that prevents complement (c)-mediated hemolysis by blocking the assembly or accelerating the decay of c3 convertase. purified daf is known to incorporate into the membrane of daf-deficient cells, inhibiting lysis. since schistosoma mansoni is a blood-dwelling parasite, we investigated whether daf can be transferred from human erythrocytes to the worm and protect it against c-mediated killing in vitro. we have found that schistosomula (schla) incubated with normal human erythrocytes (n-hue), but not with daf-deficient erythrocytes, become resistant to c damage in vitro. protected parasites acquire a 70-kd surface protein which can be immunoprecipitated by anti-daf antibodies. the acquired resistance is abrogated by treatment of n-hue-incubated parasites with anti-daf antibody. these results indicate that, in vitro, n-hue daf can be transferred to schla, and suggest its participation in preventing their c-mediated killing. this could represent an important strategy of parasites to evade the host's immune response in vivo.\n",

      "Abstract: in the mouse, infection with schistosoma mansoni results in an egg- producing infection and associated disease, whereas vaccination with attenuated larval stages produces a substantial and specific immunity in the absence of egg-induced pathology. preliminary data showing enhanced interleukin-5 (il-5) production by t cells from infected mice and interferon gamma (ifn-gamma) synthesis by cells from vaccinated animals (7), suggested differential cd4+ subset stimulation by the different parasite stimuli. to confirm this hypothesis, lymphocytes from vaccinated or infected animals were compared for their ability to produce ifn-gamma and il-2 (secreted by th1 cells) as compared with il- 4 and il-5 (characteristic th2 cytokines). after stimulation with specific antigen or mitogen, t cells from vaccinated mice or prepatently infected animals responded primarily with th1 lymphokines, whereas lymphocytes from patently infected mice instead produced th2 cytokines. the th2 response in infected animals was shown to be induced by schistosome eggs and directed largely against egg antigens, whereas the th1 reactivity in vaccinated mice was triggered primarily by larval antigens. interestingly, th1 responses in mice carrying egg-producing infections were found to be profoundly downregulated. moreover, the injection of eggs into vaccinated mice resulted in a reduction of antigen and mitogen-stimulated th1 function accompanied by a coincident expression of th2 responses. together, the data suggest that coincident with the induction of th2 responses, murine schistosome infection results in an inhibition of potentially protective th1 function. this previously unrecognized downregulation of th1 cytokine production may be an important immunological consequence of helminth infection related to host adaptation.\n",

      "Abstract: our observations show that young rabbits born of mothers afflicted with schistosomum japonicum develop typical rickets. rickets can also be produced if we infect the young, healthy rabbits with the same parasite. it is natural to suppose that the rachitic changes are caused by the parasite itself. since, however, a similar disease can be produced in the offspring, when the mother is fed on egg yolk, the causation is not limited to the action of this parasitic toxin alone. the toxin of schistosoma may disturb the calcium and phosphorus metabolism of bone in young animals, especially in the period of vigorous growth; that is, 20 to 40 days after birth of the rabbits. or it may exhaust some element important in the calcium and phosphorus metabolism such as vitamin a or d. the fact that exhaustion of the antirachitic factor in the mother causes rickets in the young, as grant (1924) showed, and that certain low grade infections can exhaust vitamin b as shown by wedgewood (1924), is in line with this conception. it may be added here that most investigations on rickets have been carried out on rats and dogs. we have found a simple and excellent way of producing rickets in rabbits by dietary deficiency. concerning this method, we shall report elsewhere.\n",

      "Abstract: schistosomiasis is among the most prevalent parasitic infections worldwide. however, current global burden of disease (gbd) disability-adjusted life year estimates indicate that its population-level impact is negligible. recent studies suggest that gbd methodologies may significantly underestimate the burden of parasitic diseases, including schistosomiasis. furthermore, strain-specific disability weights have not been established for schistosomiasis, and the magnitude of human disease burden due to schistosoma japonicum remains controversial. we used a decision model to quantify an alternative disability weight estimate of the burden of human disease due to s. japonicum. we reviewed s. japonicum morbidity data, and constructed decision trees for all infected persons and two age-specific strata, <15 years (y) and ≥15 y. we conducted stochastic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses for each model. infection with s. japonicum was associated with an average disability weight of 0.132, with age-specific disability weights of 0.098 (<15 y) and 0.186 (≥15 y). re-estimated disability weights were seven to 46 times greater than current gbd measures; no simulations produced disability weight estimates lower than 0.009. nutritional morbidities had the greatest contribution to the s. japonicum disability weight in the <15 y model, whereas major organ pathologies were the most critical variables in the older age group. gbd disability weights for schistosomiasis urgently need to be revised, and species-specific disability weights should be established. even a marginal increase in current estimates would result in a substantial rise in the estimated global burden of schistosomiasis, and have considerable implications for public health prioritization and resource allocation for schistosomiasis research, monitoring, and control.schistosomiasis is a parasitic infection caused by a flatworm that disproportionately affects the world's poorest populations. schistosomiasis is one of the most common infections worldwide, affecting over 207 million people in 76 countries. current international estimates indicate that schistosomiasis has a minimal impact at the population level. this has contributed to its low prioritization in global health and subsequent resource allocation for disease control. however, recent studies indicate that these measures underestimate the extent of neglected tropical diseases, including schistosomiasis. despite world health organization recommendations, the burden of schistosomiasis has not been re-examined in over a decade, and there are no established estimates for different types of schistosomiasis. the impact of symptoms associated with the asian strain, schistosoma japonicum, remains controversial. this study was conducted to provide an alternate measure of the burden of s. japonicum. we reviewed the literature and calculated a summary estimate for s. japonicum which was seven to 46 times greater than current measures for schistosomiasis. findings suggest that current measures severely underestimate the extent of schistosomiasis, and urgently need to be revised. further research is needed to examine the burden of schistosomiasis and other forgotten tropical diseases affecting the world's poorest people in endemic countries.\n",

      "Abstract: cationic amino acid transporters (cat) are important regulators of nos2 and arg1 activity because they regulate l-arginine availability. however, their role in the development of th1/th2 effector functions following infection has not been investigated. here we dissect the function of cat2 by studying two infectious disease models characterized by the development of polarized th1 or th2-type responses. we show that cat2−/− mice are significantly more susceptible to the th1-inducing pathogen toxoplasma gondii. although t. gondii infected cat2−/− mice developed stronger ifn-γ responses, nitric oxide (no) production was significantly impaired, which contributed to their enhanced susceptibility. in contrast, cat2−/− mice infected with the th2-inducing pathogen schistosoma mansoni displayed no change in susceptibility to infection, although they succumbed to schistosomiasis at an accelerated rate. granuloma formation and fibrosis, pathological features regulated by th2 cytokines, were also exacerbated even though their th2 response was reduced. finally, while il-13 blockade was highly efficacious in wild-type mice, the development of fibrosis in cat2−/− mice was largely il-13-independent. instead, the exacerbated pathology was associated with increased arginase activity in fibroblasts and alternatively activated macrophages, both in vitro and in vivo. thus, by controlling nos2 and arginase activity, cat2 functions as a potent regulator of immunity.recent studies conducted with amino transporter slc7a2-deficient mice (cat2) demonstrated that nos2 activity in macrophages is regulated by cat2. nos2, which synthesizes nitric oxide, regulates numerous important activities, including resistance to infectious organisms, tumor development, and autoimmune diseases. it also competes with the enzyme arginase-1 (arg1) for the common substrate l-arginine. however, the role cat2 in the regulation of arg1 activity has not been previously examined. therefore, we infected cat2-deficient mice with the helminth parasite schistosoma mansoni or with the protozoan pathogen toxoplasma gondii, two organisms that trigger highly divergent host immune responses. strikingly, following infection with s. mansoni, cat2−/− mice developed parasite egg–induced lesions in the liver that were 3 to 4 times larger than wild type and hepatic fibrosis (a feature of severe schistosomiasis) was exacerbated, indicating a general worsening of disease in the absence of cat2. the cat2−/− mice were also more susceptible to t. gondii infection, demonstrating that cat2 is critical for the development of protective cell-mediated immunity. thus, these studies identify cat2 as a powerful regulator of host immune responses, which may have major implications for a variety of infectious, inflammatory, and autoimmune diseases.\n",

      "Abstract: background\n",
      "schistosomiasis in humans along the lower mekong river has proven a persistent public health problem in the region. the causative agent is the parasite schistosoma mekongi (trematoda: digenea). a new transmission focus is reported, as well as the first study of genetic variation among s. mekongi populations. the aim is to confirm the identity of the species involved at each known focus of mekong schistosomiasis transmission, to examine historical relationships among the populations and related taxa, and to provide data for use (a priori) in further studies of the origins, radiation, and future dispersal capabilities of s. mekongi.\n",
      "methodology/principal findings\n",
      "dna sequence data are presented for four populations of s. mekongi from cambodia and southern laos, three of which were distinguishable at the coi (cox1) and 12s (rrns) mitochondrial loci sampled. a phylogeny was estimated for these populations and the other members of the schistosoma sinensium group. the study provides new dna sequence data for three new populations and one new locus/population combination. a bayesian approach is used to estimate divergence dates for events within the s. sinensium group and among the s. mekongi populations.\n",
      "conclusions/significance\n",
      "the date estimates are consistent with phylogeographical hypotheses describing a pliocene radiation of the s. sinensium group and a mid-pleistocene invasion of southeast asia by s. mekongi. the date estimates also provide bayesian priors for future work on the evolution of s. mekongi. the public health implications of s. mekongi transmission outside the lower mekong river are also discussed.\n",

      "Abstract: schistosoma egg-induced liver granuloma is a dynamic inflammatory reaction that results from complex immune responses to the infection. however, the role of b cells in inflammatory granuloma development is not yet fully understood. we report here that b cell function is required for s. japonicum egg-induced granuloma pathology in early infection. both obf-1 knockout mice and µmt mice develop severely reduced hepatic granulomas at five weeks post-infection compared to their wild-type counterparts. in contrast, they display no significant difference in granuloma pathology at eight weeks post-infection. moreover, we find that b cells and antibodies accumulate in the granulomas of wild-type mice early in the infection, indicating a contribution of the b cell response to the granulomatous inflammation. furthermore, defects in b cell function markedly reduce liver egg burden. these results suggest an important role for b cells in early granuloma pathology. surprisingly, we found that the s. japonicum infection destroys the structure of the lymphoid follicles. this disruptive effect is correlated with a severely impaired t cell-dependent antibody response upon challenge with ovalbumin. thus, these findings reveal a novel aspect of the interaction between schistosoma and the host immune system.\n",

      "Abstract: background\n",
      "schistosomiasis is a chronic, debilitating parasitic disease infecting more than 200 million people and is second only to malaria in terms of public health importance. due to the lack of a vaccine, patient therapy is heavily reliant on chemotherapy with praziquantel as the world health organization–recommended drug, but concerns over drug resistance encourage the search for new drug leads.\n",
      "methods and findings\n",
      "the efficacy of the vinyl sulfone cysteine protease inhibitor k11777 was tested in the murine model of schistosomiasis mansoni. disease parameters measured were worm and egg burdens, and organ pathology including hepato- and splenomegaly, presence of parasite egg–induced granulomas in the liver, and levels of circulating alanine aminotransferase activity as a marker of hepatocellular function. k11777 (25 mg/kg twice daily [bid]), administered intraperitoneally at the time of parasite migration through the skin and lungs (days 1–14 postinfection [p.i.]), resulted in parasitologic cure (elimination of parasite eggs) in five of seven cases and a resolution of other disease parameters. k11777 (50 mg/kg bid), administered at the commencement of egg-laying by mature parasites (days 30–37 p.i.), reduced worm and egg burdens, and ameliorated organ pathology. using protease class-specific substrates and active-site labeling, one molecular target of k11777 was identified as the gut-associated cathepsin b1 cysteine protease, although other cysteine protease targets are not excluded. in rodents, dogs, and primates, k11777 is nonmutagenic with satisfactory safety and pharmacokinetic profiles.\n",

      "background.\n",
      "schistosomiasis, a disease caused by a type of parasitic flatworm that lives in the blood, infects around 200 million people worldwide. the disease is a serious problem in sub-saharan africa, south america, china, and southeast asia. although this disease can kill, it is better known as a lifelong chronic infection with debilitating symptoms mainly due to an immune reaction raised against parasite eggs trapped in the liver, spleen, and gut. the worm's life cycle is complicated and involves a free-swimming form that emerges from certain types of snails that live in lakes and ponds. this can penetrate the skin of people in contact with the water. after a period spent in the skin and around the lungs, the parasites move to veins around the gut, and develop into adult worms that mate and lay eggs. these eggs eventually return to the water through the person's feces or urine. a particular group of proteins called cysteine proteases are thought to be very important in the biology of these worms, especially in their function as digestive enzymes in the parasite's gut. these proteases could represent an exciting opportunity for development of new drugs to treat schistosomiasis. the researchers are looking at whether it is possible to block the activity of cysteine proteases and, as a result, kill the worms or prevent them from developing and thriving.\n",
      "why was this study done?\n",
      "at the moment there is only one drug, praziquantel, in common use for treatment of schistosomiasis; it is cheap and effective. however many organizations are worried about relying on a single drug to treat a serious disease which affects so many people worldwide. the research group here has been looking at molecules that block cysteine protease activity, to see if any of these could be good drug candidates for schistosomiasis. one molecule they have been looking at goes by the name of k11777, which is under evaluation as a drug candidate for another parasitic infection (chagas' disease). here, the researchers wanted to find out whether k11777 had any activity against schistosome worms.\n",
      "what did the researchers do and find?\n",
      "in this study, the researchers deliberately infected laboratory mice with the schistosome parasite. these mice were then either injected with k11777 solution twice daily, or with equivalent volumes of water as a comparison. the researchers examined the effects of injecting k11777 either “early” in infection (using a 14 day course, starting 1 day after infection with the parasite) or “late” in the worms' development (using an 8 day treatment course starting 30 days after infection). the outcomes used as measures of success of treatment with k11777 included the number of worms recovered from mice after euthanasia, the number of worm eggs counted in the liver; the extent of the damage to the liver; and finally, the researchers also looked at activity levels of cysteine proteases in the worms themselves, in particular, those proteases associated with the parasite gut.the results of the early-treatment experiment showed a substantial decrease in worm numbers and egg production. in five of the seven mice treated, eggs were eliminated entirely. also, there was little measurable liver damage. for the late-treatment experiment, decreased burdens of worms and eggs in the livers of k11777 treated mice were also found, and there was less damage to the livers. those worms surviving treatment and removed from mice also had much less activity of gut cysteine proteases suggesting that k11777 exerts its effects by targeting worm cysteine proteases.\n",
      "what do these findings mean?\n",
      "these experiments show that k11777 is a potent antischistosomal agent in mice. it might therefore be a good ‘candidate' molecule for developing future treatments for human schistosomiasis. however, before that stage can be reached, it would be important to carry out clinical trials to test whether k11777 is both safe and effective in schistosomiasis patients. full details as to which worm cysteine protease(s) is the critical target of k11777 would also need to be worked out, and more information would be needed as to whether the dosing plan used in this study (twice-daily injections for a week to 14 days) can be decreased.\n",

      "Abstract: this study intended to characterize pharmacologically the mediator(s) released in the inflammation induced by soluble egg antigen (sea), the main antigen released from eggs of schistosoma mansoni, in rat hindpaws. a single intraplantar injection of 0.1-100 microg sea at day zero induced a dose-dependent increase in the volume of rat hindpaws characterizing an oedema of quick onset (within 15 min) and 4h-duration, which was confirmed by histopathological analysis of the paws. a second injection of sea in the same paw (1-10 microg) 28 days later induced an increased dose-dependent oedematogenic response. the early oedematogenic response following sea sensitization was derived from serotonin release and interleukin-1 (il-1), since treatment with either pizotifen or an antibody against il-1, reduced the response by 60% and 48%, respectively. the increased oedematogenic response derived from sea-challenge (10 microg) of rat paws derived from a local rather than systemic reaction, since it was not observed if the sensitization was in the contralateral paw or the peritoneal cavity of the animals. chronic treatment with inhibitors of il-2 synthesis/release such as cyclosporin or dexamethasone during the sensitization phase reduced the oedematogenic response due to sea challenge by 51% and 55%, respectively. these data suggested that sea-challenge was immune-derived and dependent of il-2 release. it is discussed the association between cytokine release and the resistance of rats to s. mansoni infection.\n",

      "Abstract: background: aging is associated with several alterations in the phenotype, repertoire and activation status of lymphocytes as well as in the cytokine profile produced by these cells. as a lifelong condition, chronic parasitic diseases such as human schistosomiasis overlaps with the aging process and no systematic study has yet addressed the changes in immune response during infection with schistosoma mansoni in older individuals. aim: herein we study the influence of immunological alterations brought about by senescence in the course of schistosomiasis. materials and methods: individuals 10-95 years of age, from both sexes, from an endemic area for s. mansoni infection were matched by intensity of infection as measured by egg counts. we analyzed, as a parameter, cytokine expression by lymphocytes and natural killer cells after in vitro stimulation with soluble egg antigen and soluble worm antigen using flow cytometry. results: we demonstrated that the frequency of cd16+ interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma)+ natural killer cells in negative individuals over the age of 70 years is significantly higher than in positive individuals after in vitro stimulation with s. mansoni antigen extracts. the frequency of these cells is increased in all individuals over the age of 50 years and only declines in positive individuals after 70 years of age. analysis of either cd4? or cd8? cells after antigen stimulation show no significant increase in frequency of ifn-gamma in negative or in positive individuals of this age group, suggesting that the effect on cd16+ cells is not t-cell dependent. conclusion: since production of ifn-gamma has been related to resistance to schistosome infection, our data suggest that age-associated changes in cd16+ cells may play a role in controlling infection intensity in the elderly in s. mansoni endemic areas of brazil.\n",

      "Abstract: background\n",
      "diagnosis of intestinal schistosomiasis in low endemic areas is a problem because often control measures have reduced egg burdens in feces to below the detection limits of classical coproparasitological methods. evaluation of molecular methods is hindered by the absence of an established standard with maximum sensitivity and specificity. one strategy to optimize method performance, where eggs are rare events, is to examine large amounts of feces. a novel diagnostic method for isolation of schistosoma mansoni eggs in feces, and an initial evaluation of its performance is reported here.\n",
      "methodology/principal findings\n",
      "known amounts of s. mansoni eggs were seeded into 30 g of normal human feces and subjected to a sequence of spontaneous sedimentation, sieving, ritchie method, incubation and isolation through interaction with paramagnetic beads. preliminary tests demonstrated the efficacy of lectins as ligands, but they also indicated that the paramagnetic beads alone were sufficient to isolate the eggs under a magnetic field through an unknown mechanism. eggs were identified by microscopic inspection, with a sensitivity of 100% at 1.3 eggs per gram of feces (epg). sensitivity gradually decreased to 25% at a concentration of 0.1 epg. in a preliminary application of the new method to the investigation of a recently established focus in southern brazil, approximately 3 times more eggs were detected than with the thick-smear kato-katz method.\n",

      "Abstract: schistosomiasis remains a serious public health problem with an estimated 200 million people infected in 76 countries. here we isolated ~ 8,400 potential protein-encoding cdna contigs from schistosoma japonicum after sequencing circa 84,000 expressed sequence tags. in tandem, we undertook a high-throughput proteomics approach to characterize the protein expression profiles of a number of developmental stages (cercariae, hepatic schistosomula, female and male adults, eggs, and miracidia) and tissues at the host-parasite interface (eggshell and tegument) by interrogating the protein database deduced from the contigs. comparative analysis of these transcriptomic and proteomic data, the latter including 3,260 proteins with putative identities, revealed differential expression of genes among the various developmental stages and sexes of s. japonicum and localization of putative secretory and membrane antigens, enzymes, and other gene products on the adult tegument and eggshell, many of which displayed genetic polymorphisms. numerous s. japonicum genes exhibited high levels of identity with those of their mammalian hosts, whereas many others appeared to be conserved only across the genus schistosoma or phylum platyhelminthes. these findings are expected to provide new insights into the pathophysiology of schistosomiasis and for the development of improved interventions for disease control and will facilitate a more fundamental understanding of schistosome biology, evolution, and the host-parasite interplay.schistosomiasis remains a major public health problem in the developing world. schistosoma japonicum, the oriental blood fluke, causes intestinal schistosomiasis in china and the philippines. knowledge of the genome and proteome of this worm should improve understanding of biomedical aspects of schistosomiasis. this study represents the first major attempt to characterize the majority of the expressed genes and proteins of a human blood fluke through rigorous, high-throughput genomic and proteomic methodologies. the findings of this study provide a unique resource of numerous schistosome genes and information on protein profiles of the different developmental stages of s. japonicum. many of the newly discovered proteins are localized on the surface of the worm and its eggs, and they are likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of schistosomiasis. furthermore, genetic variants found in many of these new genes likely reflect the ability of this important human pathogen to adapt and respond to environmental pressures and the capacity of the parasite to respond to anti-schistosomal therapies. comparison of these s. japonicum genes with those from mammals and other organisms will facilitate advances in the understanding of blood fluke biology and evolution.\n",

      "Abstract: background\n",
      "schistosoma japonicum is a major public health concern in china, with over one million people infected and another 40 million living in areas at risk of infection. unlike the disease caused by s. mansoni and s. haematobium, schistosomiasis japonica is a zoonosis, involving a number of different mammalian species as reservoir hosts. as a result of a number of published reports from china, it has long been considered that bovines, particularly water buffaloes, play a major role in human s. japonicum transmission there, and a drug-based intervention study (1998–2003) around the poyang lake in jiangxi province provided proof of concept that water buffaloes are, indeed, major reservoirs of human infection in this setting.\n",
      "methods and findings\n",
      "in this study we incorporated recently obtained epidemiological information to model the steady-state s. japonicum transmission as well as the impact of the removal of s. japonicum transmission attributable to water buffaloes on human infection rates across six different endemic scenarios within three villages in the dongting (hunan) and poyang (jiangxi) lakes of southern china. similar results were obtained for all scenarios. steady-state s. japonicum infection rates remained constant and human prevalence and incidence were predicted to fall considerably over time. the model showed that the contribution of s. japonicum water buffalo transmission to human infection ranged from 39.1% to 99.1% and predicted that the removal of water buffalo transmission would reduce parasite reproductive rates below 1. this indicates that without the contribution of water buffaloes, s. japonicum transmission is interrupted and unsustainable. these scenarios are generalizable to other endemic villages in the lake and marshland areas of china where a similar cycle of snail infection and infection/reinfection of humans and bovines occurs.\n",
      "conclusions\n",
      "along with previous epidemiological data, our findings strongly support water buffaloes as an important component of the transmission cycle that affects humans in the lake and marshlands region of china, a feature which appears to differ from the situation prevalent in the philippines where their contribution is less pronounced. our conclusions underscore the rationale for removal, replacement or treatment of water buffaloes, and for the development and deployment of a transmission blocking buffalo vaccine against s. japonicum for this setting to achieve the goal of transmission control. the chinese government has recently commenced a new integrated national strategy to improve on existing approaches to control schistosomiasis in the lake and marshlands region by reducing bovines and humans as a source of s. japonicum infection to oncomelania snails.\n",

      "Title: emerging and reemerging helminthiases and the public health of china.\n",
      "Abstract: despite great strides in their control throughout the people's republic of china, helminth infections remain an important public health problem. the institute of parasitic diseases of the chinese academy of preventive medicine, under the guidance of the chinese ministry of health, completed a nationwide survey of more than 1 million people that showed the high prevalence and intensity of intestinal nematode infections; prevalence can sometimes exceed 50% in the yangtze river valley provinces. schistosoma japonicum is also a major cause of illness in this region. attempts to control chinese helminthic diseases with conventional anthelminthic drugs have been partially thwarted by high posttreatment rates of reinfection. recently, several new human trematode pathogens have been identified. novel approaches to chemoprophylaxis and vaccination may alleviate the public health problem caused by chinese helminths. however, recombinant helminth vaccine development will depend on first cataloguing the extensive genetic diversity of chinese helminths and candidate vaccine antigens. evidence from biogeography, genetics, and systematics suggests that the genetic diversification of chinese helminths and their vectors is an ongoing evolutionary process that began 12 million years ago near the convergence of major asian river systems. construction of the three gorges super dam on the yangtze river may promote the emergence and reemergence of new helminths and their snail vectors\n",

      "Abstract: a transcriptional product of a gene encoding cathepsin b-like peptidase in the bird schistosome trichobilharzia regenti was identified and cloned. the enzyme was named trcb2 due to its 77% sequence similarity to cathepsin b2 from the important human parasite schistosoma mansoni. the zymogen was expressed in the methylotropic yeast pichia pastoris; procathepsin b2 underwent self-processing in yeast media. the peptidolytic activity of the recombinant enzyme was characterised using synthetic fluorogenic peptide substrates at optimal ph 6.0. functional studies using different specific inhibitors proved the typical cathepsin b-like nature of the enzyme. the s2 subsite specificity profile of recombinant trcb2 was obtained. using monospecific antibodies against the recombinant enzyme, the presence of cathepsin b2 was confirmed in extracts from cercariae (infective stage) and schistosomula (early post-cercarial stage) of t. regenti on western blots. also, cross-reactivity was observed between t. regenti and s. mansoni cathepsins b2 in extracts of cercariae, schistosomula or adults. in t. regenti, the antisera localised the enzyme to post-acetabular penetration glands of cercariae implying an important role in the penetration of host skin. the ability of recombinant trcb2 to degrade skin, serum and nervous tissue proteins was evident. elastinolytic activity suggests that the enzyme might functionally substitute the histolytic role of the serine class elastase known from s. mansoni and schistosoma haematobium but not found in schistosoma japonicum or in bird schistosomes.\n",

      "Abstract: human buffy coat cells adhering to schistosomula of schistosoma mansoni that were preincubated in fluorochrome-conjugated concanavalin a (con a), wheat germ agglutinin, lentil lectin, or purified igg from a hyperimmunized rabbit, were examined by fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy and by freeze-fracture. all four fluorochrome- conjugated multivalent ligands were homogeneously distributed on the parasite surface after preincubation. within 1-3 h after the addition of cells, large areas of nonfluorescence, 10-20 micrometer in diameter, were seen on the parasite surface. in addition, the fluorochromes were observed in granules within the cells. electron microscope autoradiography of worms preincubated with 125i-con a showed silver grains evenly distributed over the tegumental membrane. after the addition of cells, grains were seen over phagolysosomes in the cytoplasm of neutrophils adhering to the parasites. in addition, no grains were present over large areas of the tegumental membrane, which still retained its normal architecture, or over fusions between the neutrophil plasma membrane and the outer tegumental membrane. rabbit igg formed an electron-dense layer on the tegumental membrane which was endocytosed by neutrophils. both neutrophils and eosinophils fused with the parasite in areas containing no electron-dense material on the surface. it is concluded that human neutrophils will endocytose a variety of multivalent ligands from the surface of schistosomula, which probably accounts for the failure of neutrophils to kill the parasite and acts to clear the parasite surface of both antigen and antibody. presumably, the components of the parasite surface which have originally bound the ligands are also endocytosed since surface components labeled by galactose oxidase and nab3h4 are taken into cells when examined by light microscope autoradiography. finally, membrane fusion occurs in areas devoid of multivalent glands, which suggests that these ligands serve to bring the cells and parasites close together, but the actual fusigens probably reside in the lipids in the outer tegumental membrane.\n",

      "Abstract: schistosomula of schistosoma mansoni were labeled by oxidation with galactose oxidase or with periodate followed by reduction with nab3h4 to study the loss of the surface membrane of these parasites in vitro. grain counts of light microscope autoradiographs (lmarg) of radiolabeled schistosomula show that both galactose oxidase and periodate specifically label the surface of the organisms. galactose oxidase labels 11 glycoproteins on the surface of skin and mechanical schistosomula, ranging in apparent molecular weight from 17,000 to greater than 105,000. these glycoproteins are lost from the surface of schistosomula with a halftime of 10-15 h in culture in defined medium. most of these glycoproteins appear to be shed intact from the surface of the schistosomula rather than endocytosed and degraded, because greater than 50% of each of the lost proteins can be recovered by trichloroacetic acid precipitation of the culture medium and because there is no internalization of the radiolabels into cultured schistosomula examined by lmarg. in addition to glycoproteins, periodate labels at least  seven glycolipids on the surface of mechanical schistosomula. after culture for 15 h, more than half of each of these periodate-labeled proteins and lipids are lost from the schistosomula, and their abundance relative to each other remains similar to that of freshly labeled organisms. since both proteins and lipids are lost from the surface of the schistosomula at the same rate, we believe that we are observing a general loss of the parasite surface membrane.\n",

      "Abstract: we have employed in situ hybridization to evaluate the molecular mechanisms responsible for hypoalbuminemia and increased liver collagen content in murine schistosomiasis. results were compared using a simplified method of hybridizing isolated hepatocytes from schistosoma mansoni-infected and normal mouse liver with mouse albumin (pmalb-2) and chick pro-alpha 2(l) collagen (pcg45) probes. whereas hepatocytes from infected mice showed significantly less albumin mrna than hepatocytes from control, there were more grains of procollagen mrna in hepatocytes from infected as compared with control liver. hybridization of infected liver tissue sections with the collagen probe showed more grains per field in granulomas than in liver regions, whereas with the albumin probe there was more hybridization in liver tissue than in granulomas. these results suggest that in murine schistosomiasis a reduction in albumin mrna sequence content may be associated with decreased albumin synthesis and ultimately leads to hypoalbuminemia. in addition, although the granuloma seems to be the primary source of type i collagen synthesis, hepatocytes are also capable of synthesizing collagen, especially under fibrogenic stimulation.\n",

      "Abstract: cercariae, the freshwater stage of schistosoma mansoni infectious to man, are covered by a single unit membrane and an immunogenic glycocalyx. when cercariae penetrate the host skin, they transform to schistosomula by shedding tails, secreting mucous and enzymes, and forming microvilli over their surface. here the loss of the glycocalyx from cercariae transforming in vitro was studied morphologically and biochemically. by scanning electron microscopy, the glycocalyx was a dense mesh composed of 15-30 nm fibrils that obscured spines on the cercarial surface. the glycocalyx was absent on organisms fixed without osmium and was partially lost when parasites aggregated in their own secretions before fixation. by transmission electron microscopy, a 1-2 microns thick mesh of 8-15-nm fibrils was seen on parasites incubated with anti-schistosomal antibodies or fixed in aldehydes containing tannic acid or ruthenium red. cercariae transformed to schistosomula when tails were removed mechanically and parasites were incubated in saline. within 5 min of transformation, organisms synchronously formed microvilli which elongated to 3-5 microns by 20 min and then were shed. however, considerable fibrillar material remained adherent to the double unit membrane surface of schistosomula. for biochemical labeling, parasites were treated with eserine sulfate, which blocked cercarial swimming, secretion, infectivity, and transformation to schistosomula. material labeled by periodate oxidation and nab3h4 was on the surface as shown by autoradiography and had an apparent molecular weight of greater than 10(6) by chromatography. periodate- nab3h4 glycocalyx had an isoelectric point of 5.0 +/- 0.4 and was precipitable with anti-schistosomal antibodies. more than 60% of the radiolabeled glycocalyx was released into the medium by transforming parasites in 3 h and was recovered as high molecular weight material. parasites labeled with periodate and fluorescein-thiosemicarbazide and then transformed had a corona of fluorescence containing microvilli, much of which was shed onto the slide. material on cercariae labeled by lodogen-catalyzed iodination was also of high molecular weight and was antigenic. in conclusion, the cercarial glycocalyx appears to be composed of acidic high molecular weight fibrils which are antigenic and incompletely cleared during transformation.\n",

      "Abstract: human red blood cells (rbcs) adhere to and are lysed by schistosomula of schistosoma mansoni. we have investigated the mechanism of rbc lysis by comparing the dynamic properties of transmembrane protein and lipid probes in adherent ghost membranes with those in control rbcs and in rbcs treated with various membrane perturbants. fluorescence photobleaching recovery was used to measure the lateral mobility of two integral membrane proteins, glycophorin and band 3, and two lipid analogues, fluorescein phosphatidylethanolamine (fl-pe) and carbocyanine dyes, in rbcs and ghosts adherent to schistosomula. adherent ghosts manifested 95-100% immobilization of both membrane proteins and 45-55% immobilization of both lipid probes. in separate experiments, diamide-induced cross-linking of rbc cytoskeletal proteins slowed transmembrane protein diffusion by 30-40%, without affecting either transmembrane protein fractional mobility or lipid probe lateral mobility. wheat germ agglutinin- and polylysine-induced cross-linking of glycophorin at the extracellular surface caused 80-95% immobilization of the transmembrane proteins, without affecting the fractional mobility of the lipid probe. egg lysophosphatidylcholine (lysopc) induced both lysis of rbcs and a concentration-dependent decrease in the lateral mobility of glycophorin, band 3, and fl-pe in ghost membranes. at a concentration of 8.4 micrograms/ml, lysopc caused a pattern of protein and lipid immobilization in rbc ghosts identical to that in ghosts adherent to schistosomula. schistosomula incubated with labeled palmitate released lysopc into the culture medium at a rate of 1.5 fmol/h per 10(3) organisms. these data suggest that lysopc is transferred from schistosomula to adherent rbcs, causing their lysis.\n",

      "Abstract: the lectin concanavalin a (con a) was used as a model probe to study the behavior of molecules bound to the surface of recently transformed schistosomula of schistosoma mansoni. con a binding was saturable (150- 180 pg/organism) and specifically competed by alpha-methyl mannoside. both fitc-con a and 125-i-con a were lost from the surface of schistosomula with a halftime of 8-10 h in culture in defined medium. a comparable decrease in the binding of con a to schistosomula cultured and then labeled with the lectin indicated that the labeling procedure itself was not inducing the observed change. internalization of con a was not seen by either fluorescence microscopy or electron microscope radioautography. in addition, 70-80% of the radioactivity lost from the parasite was recoverable by tca precipitation from the culture medium as intact con a (27,000 mol wt on sds page). thus, the mechanism of clearance of bound con a from the surface of cultured schistosomula is apparently by sloughing of con a molecules intact into the culture media and not by endocytosis and degradation. con a binding sites, visualized with hemocyanin by scanning electron microscopy, appeared homogeneously distributed over the surface of schistosomula when organisms were labeled at 4 degree c or after fixation with glutaraldehyde. however, con a and hemocyanin formed aggregates on the surface of schistosomula when labeling was performed at 37 degrees c, which suggests that lectin binding sites have lateral mobility within the plane of the membrane. these aggregates are likely independent of metabolism by the parasite because aggregation also occurs on the surface of organisms killed with azide.\n",

      "Abstract: we studied the adherence of human erythrocytes to larvae of the intravascular parasite schistosoma mansoni by transmission microscopy, freeze fracture, and fluorescence techniques. in addition, we used the adherent cells to investigate the problem of host antigen acquisition. schistosomula were cultured for from 24 to 48 h after transformation in order to clear the remnants of the cercarial glycocalyx. in some cases, the worms were preincubated with wheat germ agglutinin to promote adherence of the erythrocytes. the results were similar with and without the lectin except that more cells attached to the lectin-coated parasites. erythrocytes adhered within a few hours and, unlike neutrophils, did not fuse with the parasite. a layer of 10-20-nm electron dense material separated the outer leaflets of the tegumental and plasma membranes. in addition, many deformed and lysed cells were seen on the parasite surface. the ability of the worm to acquire erythrocyte membrane constituents was tested with carbocyanine dyes, fluorescein covalently conjugated to glycophorin, monoclonal antibodies against b and h blood group glycolipids, and rabbit alpha-human erythrocyte igg. in summary, glycophorin, erythrocyte proteins, and glycolipids were not transferred to the parasite membrane within 48 h. carbocyanine dyes were rapidly transferred to the parasite with or without lectin preincubation. thus, the dye in the worm membrane came from both adherent and nonadherent cells. these studies suggest that, in the absence of membrane fusion, the parasite may acquire some lipid molecules similar in structure to host membrane glycolipids by simple transfer through the medium but that b and h glycolipids and erythrocyte membrane proteins are not transferred from adhering cells to the worm.\n",

      "Abstract: the technique of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching was used to measure the lateral diffusion of fluorescent lipid analogues in the surface membrane of schistosoma mansoni. our data reveal that although some lipids could diffuse freely others exhibited restricted lateral diffusion. quenching of lipid fluorescence by a non-permeant quencher, trypan blue, showed that there was an asymmetric distribution of lipids across the double bilayer of mature parasites. those lipids that diffused freely were found to reside mainly in the external monolayer of the outer membrane whereas lipids with restricted lateral diffusion were located mainly in one or more of the monolayers beneath the external monolayer. formation of surface membrane blebs allowed us to measure the lateral diffusion of lipids in the membrane without the influence of underlying cytoskeletal structures. the restricted diffusion found on the normal surface membrane of mature parasites was found to be released in membrane blebs. quenching of fluorescent lipids on blebs indicated that all probes were present almost entirely in the external monolayer. juvenile worms exhibited lower lateral diffusion coefficients than mature parasites: in addition, the lipids partitioned into the external monolayer. the results are discussed in terms of membrane organization, cytoskeletal contacts, and biological significance.\n",

      "during invasion of human skin by schistosome blood fluke larvae (cercariae), a multicellular organism breaches the epidermis, basement membrane, and dermal barriers of skin. to better understand the pathobiology of this initial event in schistosome infection, a proteome analysis of human skin was carried out following invasion by cercariae of schistosoma mansoni.\n",
      "methodology and results\n",
      "human skin samples were exposed to cercariae for one-half hour to two hours. controls were exposed to water used to collect cercariae in an identical manner, and punctured to simulate cercarial tunnels. fluid from both control and experimental samples was analyzed by lc/ms/ms using a linear ion trap in “triple play” mode. the coexistence of proteins released by cercariae and host skin proteins from epidermis and basement membrane confirmed that cercarial tunnels in skin were sampled. among the abundant proteins secreted by cercariae was the cercarial protease that has been implicated in degradation of host proteins, secreted proteins proposed to mediate immune invasion by larvae, and proteins implicated in protection of parasites against oxidative stress. components of the schistosome surface tegument, previously identified with immune serum, were also released. both lysis and apoptosis of epidermal cells took place during cercarial invasion of the epidermis. components of lysed epidermal cells, including desmosome proteins which link cells in the stratum granulosum and stratum spinosum, were identified. while macrophage-derived proteins were present, no mast cell or lymphocyte cytokines were identified. there were, however, abundant immunoglobulins, complement factors, and serine protease inhibitors in skin. control skin samples incubated with water for the same period as experimental samples ensured that invasion-related proteins and host protein fragments were not due to nonspecific degeneration of the skin samples.\n",
      "conclusions\n",
      "this analysis identified secreted proteins from invasive larvae that are released during invasion of human skin. analysis of specific host proteins in skin invaded by cercariae served to highlight both the histolytic events facilitating cercarial invasion, and the host defenses that attempt to arrest or retard invasion. proteins abundant in psoriatic skin or uv and heat-stressed skin were not abundant in skin invaded by cercariae, suggesting that results did not reflect general stress in the surgically removed skin specimen. abundant immunoglobulins, complement factors, and serine protease inhibitors in skin form a biochemical barrier that complements the structural barrier of the epidermis, basement membrane, and dermis. the fragmentation of some of these host proteins suggests that breaching of host defenses by cercariae includes specific degradation of immunoglobulins and complement, and either degradation of, or overwhelming the host protease inhibitor repertoire.\n",

      "Abstract: human neutrophils and eosinophils adhere to the surface of schistosomula of schistosoma mansoni that have been preincubated with antischistosomular sera with or without complement. neutrophils are seen to form small (< 0.5 micrometer), heptalaminar and large (5-8 micrometer), pentalaminar fusions with the normal pentalaminar parasite surface membrane. by freeze-fracture techniques, attachment areas 5-8 micrometer in diameter are seen to form between neutrophils and schistosomula. these areas have three zones--an edge and two centrally located areas, one of which is rich and one of which is poor in intramembrane particles (imps). the edge zone is continuous around the attachment areas and is usually composed of a skip-fracture that passes out of the schistosomular outer membrane into the inner membrane. in some cases, the edge zone is made up of a string of imps. the imp-rich central areas have an imp concentration similar to that of unattached neutrophil membranes, are raised off of the surface of the schistosomulum, and have two normal schistosomular membranes underneath indicating that they are indeed unattached. the imp-poor central areas are composed of a fused or hybrid membrane that is continuous with the neutrophil plasma membrane but that bears the same spatial relationship to the schistosomular inner membrane that the normal outer membrane does. similar changes are seen in samples prepared with glycerination. eosinophils generally do not fuse with the schistosomular outer membrane but, instead, discharge their granular contents onto the surface of the schistosomula and appear to adhere to the parasite through this discharged material. it is suggested that schistosomula have a capability to fuse with mammalian cells and that this fusion proceeds from a fusion of the outer leaflets to a fusion of the bilayers, as appears also to be the case in other systems.\n",

      "Abstract: neutrophils and eosinophils adhering to the surface of schistosomula of schistosoma mansoni have been partially or completely detached with hypertonic sucrose or by pipetting. the sucrose-treated neutrophils are attached only in areas where there are pentalaminar fusions between the neutrophil and tegumental membranes, suggesting that these fusions attach the cells to the parasites. pipetting breaks many of the attached cells. in thin section, the tegumental membrane underlying these cells is seen to be pentalaminar. by freeze-fracture techniques, modified attachment areas are found. the edge zone often appears as a single strand of intramembrane particles (imps) on the p2 face and as a groove on the e2 face. the edge zone may also have large discontinuities, in which case it no longer separates membrane faces of unequal imp density from one another. in addition, the imps on the imp- rich areas become aggregated and surrounded by craters in the membrane. these experiments suggest that the fusions may be the mechanism by which the parasite acquires some host membrane components on its surface. on the other hand, eosinophil plasma membranes are seen adhering to a layer of electron-dense material on the parasite after the cells have been disrupted by pipetting. this suggests that eosinophils adhere to the parasite surface through their discharged granule material and not by membrane fusions.\n",

      "Abstract: invertebrates were long thought to possess only a simple, effective and hence non-adaptive defence system against microbial and parasitic attacks. however, recent studies have shown that invertebrate immunity also relies on immune receptors that diversify (e.g. in echinoderms, insects and mollusks (biomphalaria glabrata)). apparently, individual or population-based polymorphism-generating mechanisms exists that permit the survival of invertebrate species exposed to parasites. consequently, the generally accepted arms race hypothesis predicts that molecular diversity and polymorphism also exist in parasites of invertebrates. we investigated the diversity and polymorphism of parasite molecules (schistosoma mansoni polymorphic mucins, smpomucs) that are key factors for the compatibility of schistosomes interacting with their host, the mollusc biomphalaria glabrata. we have elucidated the complex cascade of mechanisms acting both at the genomic level and during expression that confer polymorphism to smpomuc. we show that smpomuc is coded by a multi-gene family whose members frequently recombine. we show that these genes are transcribed in an individual-specific manner, and that for each gene, multiple splice variants exist. finally, we reveal the impact of this polymorphism on the smpomuc glycosylation status. our data support the view that s. mansoni has evolved a complex hierarchical system that efficiently generates a high degree of polymorphism—a “controlled chaos”—based on a relatively low number of genes. this contrasts with protozoan parasites that generate antigenic variation from large sets of genes such as trypanosoma cruzi, trypanosoma brucei and plasmodium falciparum. our data support the view that the interaction between parasites and their invertebrate hosts are far more complex than previously thought. while most studies in this matter have focused on invertebrate host diversification, we clearly show that diversifying mechanisms also exist on the parasite side of the interaction. our findings shed new light on how and why invertebrate immunity develops.contrary to the traditional view that immunity in invertebrates is limited to non-specific mechanisms, recent studies have shown that they have diverse, specific immune receptors. an example is provided by the freps of the mollusk biomphalaria glabrata, polymorphic members of the immunoglobulin superfamily. this capacity for an individual or population-based polymorphic immune response raises the question of whether a corresponding polymorphism exists in parasites of invertebrates, as would be expected in an “arms race” between host and parasite. we have indeed identified such polymorphic molecules in schistosoma mansoni, a flatworm parasite of b. glabrata, by comparing two strains of schistosome that are respectively compatible and incompatible with the same mollusk host strain. however, in contrast to antigenic variation in protozoan parasites that is based on an extensive gene repertoire, we show here that a high level of polymorphism in these s. mansoni polymorphic mucins (smpomucs) is generated from a low number of genes by a complex cascade of mechanisms, a “controlled chaos”.\n",

      "Abstract: in china alone, an estimated 30 million people are at risk of schistosomiasis, caused by the schistosoma japonicum parasite. disease has re-emerged in several regions that had previously attained transmission control, reinforcing the need for active surveillance. the environmental stage of the parasite is known to exhibit high spatial and temporal variability, and current detection techniques rely on a sentinel mouse method which has serious limitations in obtaining data in both time and space. here we describe a real-time pcr assay to quantitatively detect s. japonicum cercariae in laboratory samples and in natural water that has been spiked with known numbers of s. japonicum. multiple primers were designed and assessed, and the best performing set, along with a taqman probe, was used to quantify s. japonicum. the resulting assay was selective, with no amplification detected for schistosoma mansoni, schistosoma haematobium, avian schistosomes nor organisms present in non-endemic surface water samples. repeated samples containing various concentrations of s. japonicum cercariae showed that the real-time pcr method had a strong linear correlation (r2 = 0.921) with light microscopy counts, and the detection limit was below the dna equivalent of half of one cercaria. various cercarial concentrations spiked in 1 liter of natural water followed by a filtration process produced positive detection from 93% of samples analyzed. the real-time pcr method performed well quantifying the relative concentrations of various spiked samples, although the absolute concentration estimates exhibited high variance across replicated samples. overall, the method has the potential to be applied to environmental water samples to produce a rapid, reliable assay for cercarial location in endemic areas.schistosomiasis ranks second only to malaria among parasitic diseases with regard to the number of people infected and those at risk. schistosoma japonicum is the species that causes human and animal disease in china, the philippines, and to a lesser extent, indonesia. recent evidence of schistosomiasis re-emergence in china has reinforced the need for active disease surveillance in these areas. schistosomiasis infection occurs through contact with water contaminated with s. japonicum cercariae, the free-living stage of the parasite shed from intermediate host snails. current practice of detecting cercariae in the environment uses sentinel mice, a method with serious limitations in which mice are exposed to environmental water and then maintained for 6 weeks before being dissected to count worms. the method is labor intensive and costly in terms of time and resources, making it logistically prohibitive to monitor water contact sites regularly or comprehensively. here we develop a quantitative pcr assay to measure s. japonicum cercariae concentration in water, providing a potential method for rapid and reliable data collection in the field, potentially replacing the use of live animal models.\n",

      "methods and findings\n",
      "using rna interference we found that tgr is essential for parasite survival; after silencing of tgr expression, in vitro parasites died within 4 d. we also found that auranofin is an efficient inhibitor of pure tgr (ki = 10 nm), able to kill parasites rapidly in culture at physiological concentrations (5 μm), and able to partially cure infected mice (worm burden reductions of ~60%). furthermore, two previously used antischistosomal compounds inhibited tgr activity, suggesting that tgr is a key target during therapy with those compounds.\n",
      "conclusions\n",
      "collectively, our results indicate that parasite tgr meets all the major criteria to be a key target for antischistosomal chemotherapy. to our knowledge this is the first validation of a schistosoma drug target using a convergence of both genetic and biochemical approaches.\n",
      "background.\n",
      "more than 200 million people are infected with schistosomes, a type of parasitic worm. schistosomes have a complex life cycle that starts with them reproducing in freshwater snails. the snails release free-swimming, infectious parasites that burrow into the skin of people who swim in the contaminated water. once in the human host, the parasites turn into larvae and migrate to the liver where they become juvenile worms. these mature into 10- to 20-mm-long adult worms and take up long-term residence in the veins draining the gut (schistosoma mansoni and s. japonicum) or bladder (s. haematobium). here, the worms mate and release eggs, some of which pass into the feces and so back into water where they hatch and infect fresh snails. schistosomiasis causes serious health problems (including chronic liver, gut, bladder, and spleen damage) in about 20 million people, making it a disease of great public-health and socioeconomic importance in the developing countries in which it mainly occurs.\n",
      "why was this study done?\n",
      "the only drug available to treat schistosomiasis is praziquantel. although it is very effective, people regularly get reinfected and need to be retreated once or twice a year. all told, 100 million people are currently being treated with praziquantel. reliance on a single drug, however, is problematic, as the parasites are likely to develop resistance to the drug over time. the identification of new drug targets in schistosomes is therefore an urgent goal. in this study, the researchers have investigated whether thioredoxin glutathione reductase (tgr), a parasitic enzyme with several functions, might be a key target for antischistosomal chemotherapy. they chose this enzyme because adult worms need to make antioxidants (chemicals that prevent oxygen from damaging cells) to protect themselves against the human immune response. antioxidant production in these worms depends on tgr; in mammalian cells, two specialized enzymes do its job. the researchers reasoned, therefore, that tgr might be an essential parasite protein and a potentially important drug target.\n",
      "what did the researchers do and find?\n",
      "the researchers made large quantities of pure tgr and tested its activity against various substrates. the enzymatic properties and substrate preferences of tgr, they found, differed somewhat from those of its mammalian counterparts. they then screened different types of compounds for their ability to inhibit tgr. praziquantel had no effect on tgr activity, but two antischistosomal compounds that are no longer used, potassium antimonyl tartrate and oltipraz, inhibited the enzyme. the most potent inhibitor of tgr, however, was a gold-containing complex called auranofin, low levels of which inhibited tgr in test tubes, completely killed larval, juvenile, and adult parasites living in laboratory dishes within hours, and more than halved the worm burden in infected mice. finally, the researchers used a technique called rna silencing to test the importance of tgr for worm survival. fragments of double-stranded rna (dsrna) stop proteins being made from messenger rna that contains an identical sequence. the addition of tgr dsrna to larval parasites in a dish greatly reduced tgr enzyme activity and killed nearly all the parasites within days.\n",
      "what do these findings mean?\n",
      "these findings suggest tgr as a key target for antischistosomal drug development. indeed, the discovery that two previously used antischistosomal compounds inhibit tgr suggests that the enzyme has already served as a target protein. the rna silencing experiment shows that tgr is essential for parasite survival, and the biochemical analyses indicate that tgr and its mammalian counterparts have different substrate specificities. thus, it should be possible to find compounds that inhibit tgr but have much less effect on the mammalian enzymes. this is certainly true for auranofin, a drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. whether auranofin will be an effective treatment for schistosomiasis remains to be seen—an agent that completely kills schistosomes in animals would be preferable. however, even a 50% reduction in worm burden would decrease the human health problems caused by schistosomiasis, and a combination of auranofin (or another tgr inhibitor) with an agent that works by a different mechanism might be more effective and would also reduce the chances of the parasite developing drug resistance.\n",

      "amongst school-aged children living in malaria endemic areas, chronic morbidity and exacerbation of morbidity associated with other infections are often not coincident with the presence or levels of plasmodium parasitaemia, but may result from long-term exposure to the parasite. studies of hepatosplenomegaly associated with schistosoma mansoni infection and exposure to plasmodium infection indicate that differences that occur over 1–2 km in levels of plasmodium transmission are related to the degree of exacerbation of hepatosplenomegaly and that plasmodium falciparum schizont antigen (pfs)-igg3 levels may be a marker for the differing levels of exposure.\n",

      "results\n",
      "for each experiment, three amplified rna microarray hybridizations and their dye swaps were analyzed. our results show that 265 transcripts are differentially expressed in adult females and 53 in adult males when mature and immature worms are compared. of the genes differentially expressed, 55% are expressed at higher levels in paired females while the remaining 45% are more expressed in unpaired ones and 56.6% are expressed at higher levels in paired male worms while the remaining 43.4% are more expressed in immature parasites. real-time rt-pcr analysis validated the microarray results. several new maturation associated transcripts were identified. genes that were up-regulated in single-sex females were mostly related to energy generation (i.e. carbohydrate and protein metabolism, generation of precursor metabolites and energy, cellular catabolism, and organelle organization and biogenesis) while genes that were down-regulated related to rna metabolism, reactive oxygen species metabolism, electron transport, organelle organization and biogenesis and protein biosynthesis.\n",

      "Title: a quantitative view of the transcriptome of schistosoma mansoni adult-worms using sage\n",
      "Abstract: background\n",
      "five species of the genus schistosoma, a parasitic trematode flatworm, are causative agents of schistosomiasis, a disease that is endemic in a large number of developing countries, affecting millions of patients around the world. by using sage (serial analysis of gene expression) we describe here the first large-scale quantitative analysis of the schistosoma mansoni transcriptome, one of the most epidemiologically relevant species of this genus.\n",
      "results\n",
      "after extracting mrna from pooled male and female adult-worms, a sage library was constructed and sequenced, generating 68,238 tags that covered more than 6,000 genes expressed in this developmental stage. an analysis of the ordered tag-list shows the genes of f10 eggshell protein, pol-polyprotein, hsp86, 14-3-3 and a transcript yet to be identified to be the five top most abundant genes in pooled adult worms. whereas only 8% of the 100 most abundant tags found in adult worms of s. mansoni could not be assigned to transcripts of this parasite, 46.9% of the total ditags could not be mapped, demonstrating that the 3 sequence of most of the rarest transcripts are still to be identified. mapping of our sage tags to s. mansoni genes suggested the occurrence of alternative-polyadenylation in at least 13 gene transcripts. most of these events seem to shorten the 3 utr of the mrnas, which may have consequences over their stability and regulation.\n",
      "conclusion\n",
      "sage revealed the frequency of expression of the majority of the s. mansoni genes. transcriptome data suggests that alternative polyadenylation is likely to be used in the control of mrna stability in this organism. when transcriptome was compared with the proteomic data available, we observed a correlation of about 50%, suggesting that both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation are important for determining protein abundance in s. mansoni. the generation of sage tags from other life-cycle stages should contribute to reveal the dynamics of gene expression in this important parasite.\n",

      "Abstract: background\n",
      "schistosomiasis continues to be a significant public health problem. this disease affects 200 million people worldwide and almost 800 million people are at risk of acquiring the infection. although vaccine development against this disease has experienced more failures than successes, encouraging results have recently been obtained using membrane-spanning protein antigens from the tegument of schistosoma mansoni. our group recently identified sm29, another antigen that is present at the adult worm tegument surface. in this study, we investigated murine cellular immune responses to recombinant (r) sm29 and tested this protein as a vaccine candidate.\n",
      "methods and findings\n",
      "we first show that sm29 is located on the surface of adult worms and lung-stage schistosomula through confocal microscopy. next, immunization of mice with rsm29 engendered 51%, 60% and 50% reduction in adult worm burdens, in intestinal eggs and in liver granuloma counts, respectively (p<0.05). protective immunity in mice was associated with high titers of specific anti-sm29 igg1 and igg2a and elevated production of ifn-γ, tnf-α and il-12, a typical th1 response. gene expression analysis of worms recovered from rsm29 vaccinated mice relative to worms from control mice revealed a significant (q<0.01) down-regulation of 495 genes and up-regulation of only 22 genes. among down-regulated genes, many of them encode surface antigens and proteins associated with immune signals, suggesting that under immune attack schistosomes reduce the expression of critical surface proteins.\n",
      "conclusion\n",
      "this study demonstrates that sm29 surface protein is a new vaccine candidate against schistosomiasis and suggests that sm29 vaccination associated with other protective critical surface antigens is the next logical strategy for improving protection.\n",

      "Abstract: background\n",
      "correlational studies strongly suggest that both genetic similarity and heterozygosity can influence female mate choice. however, the influence of each variable has usually been tested independently, although similarity and heterozygosity might be correlated. we experimentally determined the relative influence of genetic similarity and heterozygosity in divorce and re-mating in the monogamous endoparasite schistosoma mansoni.\n",
      "methodology/principal findings\n",
      "we performed sequential infections of vertebrate hosts with controlled larval populations of parasites, where sex and individual genetic diversity and similarity were predetermined before infection. divorce rate increased significantly when females were given the opportunity to increase genetic dissimilarity through re-mating with a new partner, independently of the intensity of male-male competition. we found however no evidence for females attempting to maximize the level of heterozygosity of their reproductive partner through divorce.\n",
      "conclusions/significance\n",
      "female preference for genetically dissimilar males should result in more heterozygous offspring. because genetic heterozygosity might partly determine the ability of parasites to counter host resistance, adaptive divorce could be an important factor in the evolutionary arms race between schistosomes and their hosts.\n",

      "Abstract: background\n",
      "schistosome eggs must traverse tissues of the intestine or bladder to escape the human host and further the life cycle. escape from host tissues is facilitated by secretion of immuno-reactive molecules by eggs and the formation of an intense strong granulomatous response by the host which acts to exclude the egg into gut or bladder lumens. schistosome eggs hatch on contact with freshwater, but the mechanisms of activation and hatching are poorly understood. in view of the lack of knowledge of the behaviour of egg hatching in schistosomes, we undertook a detailed dynamic and correlative study of the hatching biology of schistosoma japonicum.\n",
      "methodology/principal findings\n",
      "hatching eggs of s. japonicum were studied using correlative light and electron microscopy (em). the hatching behaviour was recorded by video microscopy. em preparative methods incorporating high pressure freezing and cryo-substitution were used to investigate ultrastructural features of the miracidium and extra-embryonic envelopes in pre-activated and activated eggs, and immediately after eggshell rupture. lectin cytochemistry was performed on egg tissues to investigate subcellular location of specific carbohydrate groups.\n",
      "conclusions/significance\n",
      "the hatching of s. japonicum eggs is a striking phenomenon, whereby the larva is liberated explosively while still encapsulated within its sub-shell envelopes. the major alterations that occur in the egg during activation are scission of the outer envelope-eggshell boundary, autolysis of the cellular inner envelope, and likely hydration of abundant complex and simple polysaccharides in the lacunal space between the miracidial larva and surrounding envelopes. these observations on hatching provide insight into the dynamic activity of the eggs and the biology of schistosomes within the host.\n",

      "the use of dna microarray technology to study global schistosoma gene expression has led to the rapid identification of novel biological processes, pathways or associations. implementation of standardized dna microarray protocols across laboratories would assist maximal interpretation of generated datasets and extend productive application of this technology.\n",
      "methodology/principal findings\n",
      "utilizing a new schistosoma mansoni oligonucleotide dna microarray composed of 37,632 elements, we show that schistosome genomic dna (gdna) hybridizes with less variation compared to complex mixed pools of s. mansoni cdna material (r = 0.993 for gdna compared to r = 0.956 for cdna during ‘self versus self’ hybridizations). furthermore, these effects are species-specific, with s. japonicum or mus musculus gdna failing to bind significantly to s. mansoni oligonucleotide dna microarrays (e.g r = 0.350 when s. mansoni gdna is co-hybridized with s. japonicum gdna). increased median fluorescent intensities (209.9) were also observed for dna microarray elements hybridized with s. mansoni gdna compared to complex mixed pools of s. mansoni cdna (112.2). exploiting these valuable characteristics, s. mansoni gdna was used in two-channel dna microarray hybridization experiments as a common reference for indirect identification of gender-associated transcripts in cercariae, a schistosome life-stage in which there is no overt sexual dimorphism. this led to the identification of 2,648 gender-associated transcripts. when compared to the 780 gender-associated transcripts identified by hybridization experiments utilizing a two-channel direct method (co-hybridization of male and female cercariae cdna), indirect methods using gdna were far superior in identifying greater quantities of differentially expressed transcripts. interestingly, both methods identified a concordant subset of 188 male-associated and 156 female-associated cercarial transcripts, respectively. gene ontology classification of these differentially expressed transcripts revealed a greater diversity of categories in male cercariae. quantitative real-time pcr analysis confirmed the dna microarray results and supported the reliability of this platform for identifying gender-associated transcripts.\n",

      "Abstract: background\n",
      "among animal models of schistosomiasis, the rhesus macaque is unique in that an infection establishes but egg excretion rapidly diminishes, potentially due to loss of adult worms from the portal system via shunts or death by immune attack.\n",
      "principal findings\n",
      "to investigate this, six rhesus macaques were exposed to schistosoma mansoni cercariae and the infection monitored until portal perfusion at 18 weeks. despite a wide variation in worm numbers recovered, fecal egg output and circulating antigen levels indicated that a substantial population had established in all animals. half the macaques had portal hypertension but only one had portacaval shunts, ruling out translocation to the lungs as the reason for loss of adult burden. many worms had a shrunken and pallid appearance, with degenerative changes in intestines and reproductive organs. tegument, gut epithelia and muscles appeared cytologically intact but the parenchyma was virtually devoid of content. an early and intense igg production correlated with low worm burden at perfusion, and blood-feeding worms cultured in the presence of serum from these animals had stunted growth. using immunoproteomics, gut digestive enzymes, tegument surface hydrolases and antioxidant enzymes were identified as targets of igg in the high responder animals.\n",
      "significance\n",

      "Abstract: background\n",
      "the parasitic trematode schistosoma mansoni is one of the major causative agents of human schistosomiasis, which afflicts 200 million people worldwide. praziquantel remains the main drug used for schistosomiasis treatment, and reliance on the single therapy has been prompting the search for new therapeutic compounds against this disease. our group has demonstrated that heme crystallization into hemozoin (hz) within the s. mansoni gut is a major heme detoxification route with lipid droplets involved in this process and acting as a potential chemotherapeutical target. in the present work, we investigated the effects of three antimalarial compounds, quinine (qn), quinidine (qnd) and quinacrine (qcr) in a murine schistosomiasis model by using a combination of biochemical, cell biology and molecular biology approaches.\n",
      "methodology/principal findings\n",
      "treatment of s. mansoni-infected female swiss mice with daily intraperitoneal injections of qn, and qnd (75 mg/kg/day) from the 11th to 17th day after infection caused significant decreases in worm burden (39%–61%) and egg production (42%–98%). hz formation was significantly inhibited (40%–65%) in female worms recovered from qn- and qnd-treated mice and correlated with reduction in the female worm burden. we also observed that qn treatment promoted remarkable ultrastructural changes in male and female worms, particularly in the gut epithelium and reduced the granulomatous reaction to parasite eggs trapped in the liver. microarray gene expression analysis indicated that qn treatment increased the expression of transcripts related to musculature, protein synthesis and repair mechanisms.\n",

      "the overall significant reduction in several disease burden parameters by the antimalarial quinoline methanols indicates that interference with hz formation in s. mansoni represents an important mechanism of schistosomicidal action of these compounds and points out the heme crystallization process as a valid chemotherapeutic target to treat schistosomiasis.\n",

      "Abstract: background\n",
      "praziquantel (pzq) is the only widely available drug to treat schistosomiasis. given the potential for drug resistance, it is prudent to search for novel therapeutics. identification of anti-schistosomal chemicals has traditionally relied on phenotypic (whole organism) screening with adult worms in vitro and/or animal models of disease—tools that limit automation and throughput with modern microtiter plate-formatted compound libraries.\n",
      "methods\n",
      "a partially automated, three-component phenotypic screen workflow is presented that utilizes at its apex the schistosomular stage of the parasite adapted to a 96-well plate format with a throughput of 640 compounds per month. hits that arise are subsequently screened in vitro against adult parasites and finally for efficacy in a murine model of disease. two go/no go criteria filters in the workflow prioritize hit compounds for tests in the animal disease model in accordance with a target drug profile that demands short-course oral therapy. the screen workflow was inaugurated with 2,160 chemically diverse natural and synthetic compounds, of which 821 are drugs already approved for human use. this affords a unique starting point to ‘reposition’ (re-profile) drugs as anti-schistosomals with potential savings in development timelines and costs.\n",
      "findings\n",
      "multiple and dynamic phenotypes could be categorized for schistosomula and adults in vitro, and a diverse set of ‘hit’ drugs and chemistries were identified, including anti-schistosomals, anthelmintics, antibiotics, and neuromodulators. of those hits prioritized for tests in the animal disease model, a number of leads were identified, one of which compares reasonably well with pzq in significantly decreasing worm and egg burdens, and disease-associated pathology. data arising from the three components of the screen are posted online as a community resource.\n",

      "Abstract: schistosomiasis, due to schistosoma mansoni, is a major health problem in many subtropical countries, and major efforts are being made to define a vaccine. in this regard, we have reported that sera from subjects with low susceptibility to infection by s. mansoni react with a major larval surface antigen (p-37), having an apparent molecular mass of 37 kd, against which sera of susceptible individuals show little reactivity. we have now cloned the cdna for this antigen by screening a schistosome cdna expression library with antibodies against the purified protein. the selected cdnas encode a protein that is specifically identified by immune human sera containing antibodies against p-37, while sera exhibiting low or no reactivity toward p-37 fail to recognize the recombinant protein. the cloned cdnas hybridize with a 1.2-kb rna that is the transcript of a single copy gene. this rna directs the synthesis of a 36.5-kd polypeptide that is precipitated by sera from the most resistant subjects. the amino acid sequence of the encoded polypeptide shows homology with the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3p-dehydrogenase (72.5% of positional identity with human glyceraldehyde-3p-dehydrogenase). antibodies against the recombinant protein identified p-37 on the larva. these findings, together with other reports, indicate that a number of conserved proteins may be major targets of host-protective immunity against s. mansoni. the hypothesis is discussed that genetic restriction of the immune response to these antigens may occur in heterogeneous human populations because of the limited number of t cell epitopes carried by these host-like proteins. such genetic effects might allow parasite transmission through nonresponder (susceptible) individuals. this hypothesis and the protective properties of p-37 can now be tested using the recombinant protein and synthetic peptides derived from selected regions of the polypeptide chain.\n",

      "Abstract: previous studies have shown that eosinophils from eosinophilic individuals differ functionally from those of normal individuals. in order to test whether agents that might induce eosinophilia could also affect eosinophil function, we have compared the capacity of culture supernatants from mononuclear cells of eosinophilic or normal individuals to enhance eosinophil activity, as reflected by an increased killing of schistosomula of schistosoma mansoni in vitro. an enhancing activity was detected, which increased both the antibody- dependent, and to some extent the antibody-independent killing of schistosomula by eosinophils, in the absence of complement. under similar conditions, the supernatants failed to stimulate an otherwise undetectable neutrophil-mediated killing. the activity could be removed from the assay by washing, without reversing previous eosinophil stimulation, and was not directly toxic to the schistosomula. preliminary characterization of the activity indicated that it was relatively heat-stable at 100 degrees c for 30 min, and had an estimated molecular weight of 35,000-45,000 as judged by g-200 sephadex fractionation. the activity was produced by a nonlymphocytic, nonspecific esterase-containing adherent mononuclear cell in the absence of either con a or antigenic stimulation. significant enhancing activity was detectable after 1 h of culture and continued for at least 25 h. protein synthesis was required for its production or release. although the activity was detectable in supernatants from both eosinophilic and normal individuals, the supernatants that demonstrated highest activity and that could be titrated out furthest were generally derived from eosinophilic individuals, suggesting that there might be some association between eosinophilia and enhanced eosinophil function.\n",

      "Abstract: macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (mip-1 alpha) is a 6-8-kd, lipopolysaccharide-inducible monocyte and neutrophil chemotactic protein that may be important in acute and chronic inflammation. the present study determined the sequential production, source, and in vivo contribution of murine mip-1 alpha in synchronized schistosoma mansoni egg pulmonary granuloma formation. granulomas were examined under conditions of primary, secondary vigorous, and secondary immunomodulated immunity. secreted mip-1 alpha was measured in 24-h supernatants from intact granulomas (700/ml) cultured with or without soluble egg antigen (sea). primary granulomas isolated from naive mice over a 16-d period showed low spontaneous mip-1 alpha production (< 1 ng/ml). however, when primary granulomas were challenged with sea, significant mip-1 alpha production was observed beginning at day 4 and peaking at day 16. intact vigorous (isolated from 8-wk-infected mice) and modulated (isolated from 20-wk-infected mice) secondary pulmonary granulomas demonstrated comparable spontaneous mip-1 alpha production. addition of sea to vigorous stage granulomas augmented expression of mip-1 alpha at all time points, whereas stimulated modulated stage granulomas did not increase production. the latter observation is likely related to endogenous immunoregulatory mechanisms reported for modulated stage animals. immunohistochemical localization of mip-1 alpha in granuloma sections and cytocentrifuge preparations from vigorous lesions localized mip-1 alpha production to macrophages within granulomas. treatment of mice with rabbit anti-mouse mip-1 alpha antibodies significantly decreased 8-d primary granuloma formation (> 40%) when compared with control mice. anti-mip-1 alpha sera also decreased vigorous (> 20%), but not modulated granuloma formation. these findings demonstrate that mip-1 alpha contributes to cellular recruitment during schistosome egg granuloma formation.\n",

      "Title: interactions between human eosinophils and schistosomula of schistosoma mansoni. ii. the mechanism of irreversible eosinophil adherence\n",
      "Abstract: previous work (1)(1) has shown that normal human eosinophils show a preferential capacity, in comparison with neutrophils, to bind to antibody- coated schistosomula of schistosoma mansoni. this effect is attributable to a temperature-dependent function of the eosinophil which renders its binding stable and irreversible by aggregated gamma globulin or staphylococcus aureus protein a. in contrast, the binding of neutrophils is readily reversible by these agents. it has now been shown that the differences observed between eosinophils and neutrophils is a property of their interaction with living schistosomula. when dead or artificially damaged schistosomula were tested, neutrophils showed a markedly enhanced capacity to adhere, in both the presence and absence of anti-chistosomular serum. subsequent experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that the strong, stable binding of eosinophils was attributable to degranulation, with release of granule contents which would then serve as ligands to bind the cell to the organism. first, an enhanced adherence both of eosinophils and of neutrophils could be demonstrated in the presence of eosinophil major basic protein (mbp) or of protamine, a high molecular weight cation. second, the binding of eosinophils induced by concanavalin a (con a) was found to differ markedly from that induced by antischistosomular serum. con a-mediated binding of eosinophils was fully reversible by alpha-methyl-mannoside, was not associated with damage to the organism, and did not lead to degranulation of the cell, as estimated by measuring the release of mbp into the culture supernate. however, induction of degranulation of concanavalin a-bound eosinophils, but not of neutrophils, with the calcium ionophore a23187 converted the reaction into one which was no longer reversible by alpha- methylmannoside and in which damage to the organism now did occur. these findings support the hypothesis that the stable binding of eosinophils is associated with degranulation, a process which may contribute to the preferential capacity of this cell to mediate antibody-dependent damage to schistosomula.\n",

      "Abstract: a 70,000 mol wt protein of schistosoma mansoni was shown to be a major immunogen that invariably elicited an antibody response in infected humans. the universality of the response to this abundant antigen was confirmed in experimental animals and included the antibody response associated with the protective irradiated cercarial vaccine. we identified the 70,000 mol wt antigen as an s. mansoni homologue of the major eukaryotic heat-shock protein hsp70 by dna sequence analysis of a cdna insert from a lambda gt11 clone expressing the antigen and located the immunodominant epitope near the cooh-terminus of the molecule. the antigenic relationship of hsp70 to schistosome infections suggested an important role for this protein in parasite development and pathogenesis.\n",

      "Abstract: the glycanic epitope of the 38,000 mr schistosoma mansoni schistosomula major immunogen defined by the iplsm1 protective mab was identified in the hemocyanin of the marine mollusc megathura crenulata, better known as klh. this antigenic community was exploited to investigate further the biological properties of this epitope. klh was shown to strongly inhibit the binding of iplsm1 mab to its 38,000 mr target antigen. immunization of naive lou rats with klh elicited the production of anti- s. mansoni antibodies capable of immunoprecipitating the 38,000 mr schistosomulum antigen. antibodies to klh mediated a marked eosinophil- dependent cytotoxicity and passively transferred immunity towards s. mansoni infection. finally, rats immunized with klh were significantly protected against a challenge with s. mansoni cercariae. the deglycosylation of klh completely abolishes its immunological and functional klh properties, indicating the participation of an oligosaccharidic epitope of the native klh that is also recognized by the sera of s. mansoni-infected patients. these observations provide new opportunities of access to the well-defined structure of a glycanic epitope potentially available for the immunoprophylaxis and seroepidemiology of schistosomiasis, and a new approach to the isotypic response towards a well-chemically defined epitope.\n",

      "Abstract: a method was developed for coupling a hapten, trinitrophenyl (tnp), to the surface of schistosomula of schistosoma mansoni which results in a minimal loss in their viability as judged by morphological examination in vitro and survival after injection in vivo. skin-stage (3-h-old) and lung-stage (5-d-old) schistosomula surface labeled in this manner were then compared for their susceptibility to killing by anti-tnp antibody- dependent effector mechanisms both in vivo and in vitro. tnp skin-stage larvae were readily rejected in mice actively immunized against tnp bovine gamma globulin and were highly susceptible to anti-tnp-dependent killing mediated either by complement or purified human eosinophils in vitro. in contrast, tnp-lung-stage schistosomula, which were shown by microfluorimetry to bind anti-tnp antibody to approximately the same extent as skin-stage schistosomula, were found to be resistant to killing by the same in vivo and in vitro mechanisms. these findings suggest that the insusceptibility of postskin-stage schistosomula to antibody-dependent killing must result at least in part from an intrinsic structural change in the integument of the parasite and cannot be caused solely by the masking of parasite antigens by acquired host molecules, a mechanism of immune evasion previously proposed for schistosomes.\n",

      "Abstract: partial immunity to schistosomiasis mansoni has been demonstrated in mice and has recently been transferred passively with serum, but not with cells. in vitro studies using human and rodent materials have demonstrated antibody-dependent cell-mediated damage to immature schistosomes (schistosomula); the cell involved in some of these in vitro systems appears to be the neutrophil and in others the eosinophil is suspected. in the present study the effect of antileukocyte sera on partial immunity to schistosomiasis was tested in vivo using quantitative assay systems for schistosomula in the lungs and adult worms in the portal venous system. mice infected with 10 cercariae of schistosoma mansoni 16 and 32 wk before challenge with 500 cercariae showed reductions in the recovery of schistosomula at 4 and 6 days of approximately 40%; adult worm recovery was reduced by 60%. treatment with antilymphocyte, antimacrophage, or antineutrophil serum had no effect on the numbers of schistosomula recovered from the lungs of immune animals, but in the mice treated with antieosinophil serum the numbers of schistosomula and adult worms recovered increased to the levels seen in normal nonimmune animals. furthermore, sera collected from the partially immune mice and passively transferred to uninfected mice conferred a marked resistance to infection as measured by recovery of schistosomula; this was also abrogated by treatment with antieosinophil serum. these studies suggest that antibody-dependent cell-mediated immunity to schistosomiasis occurs in vivo, and also establishes a role for the eosinophil in immune systems.\n",

      "Abstract: factors stimulating eosinophil differentiation in vitro have been studied by means of a liquid bone marrow culture system in which the number of eosinophils is estimated directly by morphology or indirectly by assay for eosinophil peroxidase. the results show that eosinophil colonies are not formed in agar, emphasizing the importance of the liquid culture system. three types of evidence identify a novel lymphokine, eosinophil-differentiating factor (edf). (a) coordinate analysis of lymphokine activity in media conditioned by a panel of parasite antigen and another panel of alloantigen-reactive t cell clones indicates that edf is distinct from interleukin 2 (il-2), il-3, and bone marrow proliferation activity (bmpa). (b) a t hybrid (nimp- th1) produces edf but no il-2, il-3, interferon, or colony-stimulating factor. (c) gel filtration of conditioned media (cm) indicates that nimp-th1 and a t clone (nimp-t2) produce edf (mr 46,000). nimp-t2 also produced il-3 (mr 26,000) but this was easily separated from edf. il-3 is also shown to have eosinophil differentiation activity (eda) but this represents a very small proportion of the eda in t2-cm. fractionation of wehi-3-cm indicates that eda from this source has a similar elution profile to il-3 (mr 35-36,000). furthermore, a comparison of the relative activities in purified il-3 and wehi-3-cm indicates that all the eda can be attributed to the il-3 in the latter. edf is shown to stimulate production of eosinophils in long-term bone marrow cultures; the kinetics of eosinophil production suggests that edf is acting on committed precursors in the bone marrow. the transient nature of eosinophil production suggests that precursors from multipotential stem cells are not produced. the eosinophils produced in these cultures are morphologically normal and functional in that they lysed sheep red blood cells coated with igg1, igg2a, and igg2b, but not with igm, iga, or ige. in addition, they were capable of adhering to and killing schistosoma mansoni schistosomula.\n",

      "Abstract: macrophages play a crucial role in the defense against tumors and parasites. activation of tumoricidal and microbicidal effector mechanisms requires stimulation of macrophages with macrophage-activating factors (maf). one such maf is interferon γ (ifn-γ). in some assays, substantial activity of ifn-γ on murine macrophages, however, is only observed in synergy with lipopolysaccharide (lps) or other cytokines (1). in addition, certain cytokines have been shown to induce monocyte or macrophage activation in the absence of ifn-γ (2-5). we previously described lymphokines in the supernatant of a murine t cell clone that synergized with ifn-γ in the induction of tumoricidal and schistosomulicidal murine macrophages (1). we called this lymphokine(s) macrophage cytotoxicityinducing factor 2 (mcif2)(1). a candidate for mcif2 was lymphotoxin (lt), because the t cell clone supernatant contained high amounts of lt. lt is functionally homologous and structurally related to the macrophage product tumor necrosis factor (tnf). therefore, we tested whether recombinant (r) lt or rtnf can function as maf. we report here that rlt or rtnf synergize with rifn-γ in the induction of tumoricidal and schistosomulicidal murine macrophages.\n",

      "Abstract: background\n",
      "many parasites of medical and veterinary importance are transmitted by cold-blooded intermediate hosts or vectors, the abundance of which will vary with ambient temperatures, potentially altering disease prevalence. in particular, if global climate change will increase mean ambient temperature in a region endemic with a human pathogen then it is possible that the incidence of disease will similarly increase. here we examine this possibility by using a mathematical model to explore the effects of increasing long-term mean ambient temperature on the prevalence and abundance of the parasite schistosoma mansoni, the causative agent of schistosomiasis in humans.\n",
      "principal findings\n",
      "the model showed that the impact of temperature on disease prevalence and abundance is not straightforward; the mean infection burden in humans increases up to 30°c, but then crashes at 35°c, primarily due to increased mortalities of the snail intermediate host. in addition, increased temperatures changed the dynamics of disease from stable, endemic infection to unstable, epidemic cycles at 35°c. however, the prevalence of infection was largely unchanged by increasing temperatures. temperature increases also affected the response of the model to changes in each parameter, indicating certain control strategies may become less effective with local temperature changes. at lower temperatures, the most effective single control strategy is to target the adult parasites through chemotherapy. however, as temperatures increase, targeting the snail intermediate hosts, for example through molluscicide use, becomes more effective.\n",
      "conclusions\n",
      "these results show that s. mansoni will not respond to increased temperatures in a linear fashion, and the optimal control strategy is likely to change as temperatures change. it is only through a mechanistic approach, incorporating the combined effects of temperature on all stages of the life-cycle, that we can begin to predict the consequences of climate change on the incidence and severity of such diseases.\n",

      "methods\n",
      "groups of outbred swiss mice were infected with 100 s. mansoni cercariae, infection maintained till weeks 10 or 14, and then somatostatin therapy delivered in two regimens – either a one or a two-day treatment. all animals were sacrificed one week after therapy and controlled for liver, spleen and total body weight. circulating somatostatin levels in mice plasma were measured at the time of sacrifice by means of a radio-immuno assay. graphpad prism® was used for statistical calculations.\n",
      "results\n",
      "somatostatin administration showed little toxicity, probably due to its short half-life. total liver and spleen weights of s. mansoni infected animals increased over time, with no changes observed due to somatostatin therapy. total body weights were decreased after infection but were not affected by somatostatin therapy. snap frozen liver sections were stained with haematoxylin-eosin or masson's trichrome to study parasite count, hepatocyte status, granuloma size and cellularity. after somatostatin treatment mean egg counts per liver section (43.76 ± 3.56) were significantly reduced as compared to the egg counts in untreated mice after 10 weeks of infection (56.01 ± 3.34) (p = 0.03). similar significant reduction in parasite egg counts were also observed after somatostatin treatment at 14 weeks of infection (56.62 ± 3.02) as compared to untreated animals (69.82 ± 2.77)(p = 0.006). fibrosis was assessed from the spectrophotometric determination of tissue hydroxyproline. infection with s. mansoni caused increased hydroxyproline levels (9.37 ± 0.63 μmol at wk10; 9.65 ± 0.96 μmol at wk14) as compared to uninfected animals (1.06 ± 0.10 μmol). this significant increase in collagen content (p = 0.01; 0.007 respectively) marks the fibrosis observed at these time points. treatment with somatostatin resulted in a significant decrease in hydroxyproline levels both at wk10 (4.76 ± 0.58 μmol) and at wk14 (5.8 ± 1.13 μmol) (p = 0.01; 0.03 respectively). endogenous somatostatin levels were increased at wk10 (297 ± 37.24 pg/ml) and wk14 (206 ± 13.30 pg/ml) of infection as compared to uninfected mice (119 ± 11.99 pg/ml) (p = 0.01; 0.008 respectively). circulating somatostatin levels in infected animals were not significantly affected by somatostatin treatment. hepatocyte status remained unaltered and granulomas were not remarkably changed in size or cellularity.\n",

      "diarrhoea is the second leading cause of illness and death in developing countries and the second commonest cause of death due to infectious diseases among children under five in such countries. parasites, as well as bacterial and viral pathogens, are important causes of diarrhoea. however, parasitic infections are sometimes overlooked, leading after a period of time to an uncertain aetiology. in this paper we report the prevalence of giardia lamblia, entamoeba histolytica and cryptosporidium sp. in and around kolkata.\n",
      "findings\n",
      "a hospital-based laboratory surveillance study was conducted among the patients admitted between november 2007 and october 2008 to the infectious diseases (id) hospital (population = 1103) with diarrhoeal complaints. of the 1103 samples collected, 147 were positive for giardia lamblia, 84 for cryptosporidium sp. and 51 for entamoeba histolytica. for all these parasites there was a high rate of mixed infection with common enteric viruses and bacteria such as rotavirus, vibrio cholerae and shigella sp. there were also cases of co-infection with all other diarrheogenic pathogens. the age group ≥ 5 years had the highest prevalence of parasites whereas the age group >5 – 10 years was predominantly infected with giardia lamblia (p =< 0.001; odds ratio (or) = 3.937; 95% confidence interval (ci) = 1.862 – 8.326) and with all parasites (p = 0.040; or = 2.043; 95% ci = 1.033 – 4.039). the age group >10 – 20 years could also be considered at risk for g. lamblia (p = 0.009; or = 2.231; 95% ci = 1.223 – 4.067). month-wise occurrence data showed an endemic presence of g. lamblia whereas cryptosporidium sp. and e. histolytica occurred sporadically. the gis study revealed that parasites were more prevalent in areas such as tangra, tiljala and rajarhat, which are mainly slum areas. because most of the population surveyed was in the lower income group, consumption of contaminated water and food could be the major underlying cause of parasitic infestations.\n",

      "Abstract: in the past decade, outbreaks of human illness associated with the consumption of raw vegetables and fruits (or unpasteurized products produced from them) have increased in the united states. changes in agronomic, harvesting, distribution, processing, and consumption patterns and practices have undoubtedly contributed to this increase. pathogens such as listeria monocytogenes, clostridium botulinum, and bacillus cereus are naturally present in some soil, and their presence on fresh produce is not rare. salmonella, escherichia coli o157:h7, campylobacter jejuni, vibrio cholerae, parasites, and viruses are more likely to contaminate fresh produce through vehicles such as raw or improperly composted manure, irrigation water containing untreated sewage, or contaminated wash water. contact with mammals, reptiles, fowl, insects, and unpasteurized products of animal origin offers another avenue through which pathogens can access produce. surfaces, including human hands, which come in contact with whole or cut produce represent potential points of contamination throughout the total system of growing, harvesting, packing, processing, shipping, and preparing produce for consumption. treatment of produce with chlorinated water reduces populations of pathogenic and other microorganisms on fresh produce but cannot eliminate them. reduction of risk for human illness associated with raw produce can be better achieved through controlling points of potential contamination in the field; during harvesting; during processing or distribution; or in retail markets, food-service facilities, or the home.\n",

      "diarrhoea is the second leading cause of illness and death in developing countries and the second commonest cause of death due to infectious diseases among children under five in such countries. parasites, as well as bacterial and viral pathogens, are important causes of diarrhoea. however, parasitic infections are sometimes overlooked, leading after a period of time to an uncertain aetiology. in this paper we report the prevalence of giardia lamblia, entamoeba histolytica and cryptosporidium sp. in and around kolkata.\n",
      "findings\n",
      "a hospital-based laboratory surveillance study was conducted among the patients admitted between november 2007 and october 2008 to the infectious diseases (id) hospital (population = 1103) with diarrhoeal complaints. of the 1103 samples collected, 147 were positive for giardia lamblia, 84 for cryptosporidium sp. and 51 for entamoeba histolytica. for all these parasites there was a high rate of mixed infection with common enteric viruses and bacteria such as rotavirus, vibrio cholerae and shigella sp. there were also cases of co-infection with all other diarrheogenic pathogens. the age group ≥ 5 years had the highest prevalence of parasites whereas the age group >5 – 10 years was predominantly infected with giardia lamblia (p =< 0.001; odds ratio (or) = 3.937; 95% confidence interval (ci) = 1.862 – 8.326) and with all parasites (p = 0.040; or = 2.043; 95% ci = 1.033 – 4.039). the age group >10 – 20 years could also be considered at risk for g. lamblia (p = 0.009; or = 2.231; 95% ci = 1.223 – 4.067). month-wise occurrence data showed an endemic presence of g. lamblia whereas cryptosporidium sp. and e. histolytica occurred sporadically. the gis study revealed that parasites were more prevalent in areas such as tangra, tiljala and rajarhat, which are mainly slum areas. because most of the population surveyed was in the lower income group, consumption of contaminated water and food could be the major underlying cause of parasitic infestations.\n",
      "conclusion\n",
      "this study provides important information on the occurrence and distribution of three important intestinal parasites and indicates their diarrheogenic capacity in kolkata and surrounding areas.\n",

      "Abstract: synthetic mosquito oviposition attractants are sorely needed for surveillance and control programs for culex species, which are major vectors of pathogens causing various human diseases, including filariasis, encephalitis, and west nile encephalomyelitis. we employed novel and conventional chemical ecology approaches to identify potential attractants, which were demonstrated in field tests to be effective for monitoring populations of cx. p. quinquefasciatus in human dwellings. immunohistochemistry studies showed that an odorant-binding protein from this species, cquiobp1, is expressed in trichoid sensilla on the antennae, including short, sharp-tipped trichoid sensilla type, which house an olfactory receptor neuron sensitive to a previously identified mosquito oviposition pheromone (mop), 6-acetoxy-5-hexadecanolide. cquiobp1 exists in monomeric and dimeric forms. monomeric cquiobp1 bound mop in a ph-dependent manner, with a change in secondary structure apparently related to the loss of binding at low ph. the pheromone antipode showed higher affinity than the natural stereoisomer. by using both cquiobp1 as a molecular target in binding assays and gas chromatography-electroantennographic detection (gc-ead), we identified nonanal, trimethylamine (tma), and skatole as test compounds. extensive field evaluations in recife, brazil, a region with high populations of cx. p. quinquefasciatus, showed that a combination of tma (0.9 µg/l) and nonanal (0.15 ng/µl) is equivalent in attraction to the currently used infusion-based lure, and superior in that the offensive smell of infusions was eliminated in the newly developed synthetic mixture.\n",

      "mosquitoes are associated with the transmission of malaria, dengue, japanese encephalitis, filariasis and other viral diseases throughout the globe, apart from being a nuisance pest. biological control alone or as a part of integrated vector management stands to be a better alternative to the chemical controls aimed against pest mosquitoes. at the same time it is necessary to control bacteria by synthetic or natural means (plant products). hence the present study was designed to screen the effect of mosquito larvicidal and antimicrobial activitiy of protein isolated from matured leaves of solanum villosum against mosquito immatures and some pathogenic bacteria.\n",
      "methods\n",
      "aqueous solvent extract of fresh mature leaves of s. villosum was tested against 3rd instar larvae of anopheles stephensi, culex quinquefasciatus and stegomyia aegypti mosquitoes and against four pathogenic bacteria. the protein fraction was isolated and tested for mosquitocidal and antibacterial activities. amino acid analysis was performed on isolated protein using pico.tag amino acid system. sds-page was also done to detect the bands of amino acid on the basis of their molecular weights.\n",

      "residents of rural villages near madang were studied prior to and one year after each of three rounds of mda with diethylcarbamazine plus albendazole administered per world health organization (who) guidelines. the mean mda compliance rate was 72.9%. three rounds of mda decreased microfilaremia rates (mf, 1 ml night blood by filter) from 18.6% pre-mda to 1.3% after the third mda (a 94% decrease). mf clearance rates in infected persons were 71%, 90.7%, and 98.1% after 1, 2, and 3 rounds of mda. rates of filarial antigenemia assessed by card test (a marker for adult worm infection) decreased from 47.5% to 17.1% (a 64% decrease) after 3 rounds of mda. the filarial antibody rate (igg4 antibodies to bm14, an indicator of filarial infection status and/or exposure to mosquito-borne infective larvae) decreased from 59.3% to 25.1% (a 54.6% decrease). mf, antigen, and antibody rates decreased more rapidly in children <11 years of age (by 100%, 84.2%, and 76.8%, respectively) relative to older individuals, perhaps reflecting their lighter infections and shorter durations of exposure/infection prior to mda. incidence rates for microfilaremia, filarial antigenemia, and antifilarial antibodies also decreased significantly after mda. filarial dna rates in anopheles punctulatus mosquitoes that had recently taken a blood meal decreased from 15.1% to 1.0% (a 92.3% decrease).\n",
      "conclusions/significance\n",
      "mda had dramatic effects on all filariasis parameters in the study area and also reduced incidence rates. follow-up studies will be needed to determine whether residual infection rates in residents of these villages are sufficient to support sustained transmission by the an. punctulatus vector. lymphatic filariasis elimination should be feasible in papua new guinea if mda can be effectively delivered to endemic populations.\n",

      "Abstract: background\n",
      "this study employed various monitoring methods to assess the impact of repeated rounds of mass drug administration (mda) on bancroftian filariasis in papua new guinea, which has the largest filariasis problem in the pacific region.\n",
      "methodology/principal findings\n",
      "residents of rural villages near madang were studied prior to and one year after each of three rounds of mda with diethylcarbamazine plus albendazole administered per world health organization (who) guidelines. the mean mda compliance rate was 72.9%. three rounds of mda decreased microfilaremia rates (mf, 1 ml night blood by filter) from 18.6% pre-mda to 1.3% after the third mda (a 94% decrease). mf clearance rates in infected persons were 71%, 90.7%, and 98.1% after 1, 2, and 3 rounds of mda. rates of filarial antigenemia assessed by card test (a marker for adult worm infection) decreased from 47.5% to 17.1% (a 64% decrease) after 3 rounds of mda. the filarial antibody rate (igg4 antibodies to bm14, an indicator of filarial infection status and/or exposure to mosquito-borne infective larvae) decreased from 59.3% to 25.1% (a 54.6% decrease). mf, antigen, and antibody rates decreased more rapidly in children <11 years of age (by 100%, 84.2%, and 76.8%, respectively) relative to older individuals, perhaps reflecting their lighter infections and shorter durations of exposure/infection prior to mda. incidence rates for microfilaremia, filarial antigenemia, and antifilarial antibodies also decreased significantly after mda. filarial dna rates in anopheles punctulatus mosquitoes that had recently taken a blood meal decreased from 15.1% to 1.0% (a 92.3% decrease).\n",
      "conclusions/significance\n",
      "mda had dramatic effects on all filariasis parameters in the study area and also reduced incidence rates. follow-up studies will be needed to determine whether residual infection rates in residents of these villages are sufficient to support sustained transmission by the an. punctulatus vector. lymphatic filariasis elimination should be feasible in papua new guinea if mda can be effectively delivered to endemic populations.\n",

      "Title: mass ivermectin treatment for onchocerciasis: lack of evidence for collateral impact on transmission of wuchereria bancrofti in areas of co-endemicity\n",
      "Abstract: there has long been interest in determining if mass ivermectin administration for onchocerciasis has 'unknowingly' interrupted lymphatic filariasis (lf) transmission where the endemicity of the two diseases' overlaps. we studied 11 communities in central nigeria entomologically for lf by performing mosquito dissections on anopheline lf vectors. six of the communities studied were located within an onchocerciasis treatment zone, and five were located outside of that zone. communities inside the treatment zone had been offered ivermectin treatment for two-five years, with a mean coverage of 81% of the eligible population (range 58–95%). we found 4.9% of mosquitoes were infected with any larval stage of w. bancrofti in the head or thorax in 362 dissections in the untreated villages compared to 4.7% infected in 549 dissections in the ivermectin treated villages (mantel-haenszel chisquare 0.02, p = 0.9). we concluded that ivermectin annual therapy for onchocerciasis has not interrupted transmission of wuchereria bancrofti (the causative agent of lf in nigeria).\n",
